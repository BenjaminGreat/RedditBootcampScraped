"<p>Hi guys I needed a little guidance with a dilemma I have. A dilemma that many of you may have faced and overcome.</p>,<p>First a little information about me. I graduated college in 2016 with a BS in ChemE and have been working full time as a process engineer since then. For all intents and purposes I have no background in programming or advanced statistics. After realizing how fun, versatile and lucrative a career in data science can be, I've decided to make a career switch into the field. </p>,<p>Now, I've been slowly self learning and over the past year and I've managed to teach myself some Python and R, but I'm still missing out on other things like SQL,Tableau,etc. I figured that with enough time and practice I can get a hang of the programming aspect of DS. But it's been very difficult for me to learn HOW to actually understand, interpret and analyze the data I am working with. And for that I strongly believe that I would need the guidance of a teacher. That's why I've been strongly considering pursuing either a MS in DS or paying for bootcamps.</p>,<p>I live in Chicago and Northwestern university has a great MS program for analytics ( <a href=""http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/analytics/overview/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/analytics/overview/</a> ) as well as 24 week part time coding bootcamp( <a href=""https://codingbootcamp.northwestern.edu"" rel=""nofollow"">https://codingbootcamp.northwestern.edu</a> ). I strongly believe that both of these programs will give me the skills and guidance I need to get establish a career in DS.(please correct me if this assumption is incorrect)</p>,<p>The way I'm looking at things now is, do the part time bootcamp while working fulltime(its more affordable that way), apply for jobs(hopefully land one successfully), work for a year or two saving up some money, and then apply for the MS in DS.</p>,<p>Is this a good idea or am I just wasting my resources and effort with the bootcamp? Or is there another option I haven't even considered?</p>,<p>Thanks in advance! :)</p>,<p>I think I might be in a similar boat as you...</p>,<p>I feel like it's kind of redundant to do both. I just finished a 3-month boot camp and I think if you're one of the top students of the boot camp, you're for sure going to do well in the job market.</p>,<p>A Masters, while costly, is going to offer a more thorough and in-depth experience. Yes, you can learn everything through MOOCs and textbooks by yourself, but they can't replace the people you get to meet from attending an actual program and meeting other students and faculty.</p>,<p>If you have the time and money I don't think doing a Masters is a bad choice. After my boot camp I do kind of wish I was able to learn the tools I used more in-depth because sometimes we'd cover something like Spark or Hadoop in a day or two when it definitely deserves more attention than that.</p>,<p>The way i see it, bootcamps are essentially accelerated BS degrees, teaching you the most important things as quickly as possible. Ideally I'd like to take my time learning and fully understand the subject matter, but practically it would be very difficult for me to take time off my job, study full time while paying of my undergrad loans and study. Thats why I'm leaning towards the bootcamp option rn. Also, how difficult was it for you to get a job after the bootcamp and did the accelerated learning process stop you from performing to meet the goals of your work?</p>,<p>I graduated from a bootcamp about 2 months ago. I've got a decent background for this stuff and have picked up the concepts and skills by working my ass off in the bootcamp and continuing to grind post bootcamp. I'm happy I chose the bootcamp over an MS but it aint easy. MS/PhD are wanted for most jobs or at least ml job experience but if you can convince them into talking with you and you know your stuff, they don't mind as much what your 'education' level is.</p>,<p>I'm still job hunting and though I got an offer from like a 1/4 ml position which I turned down I have yet to receive an offer from a true DS offer yet. That being said I'm still moving forward and enjoying learning this stuff and brainstorming project ideas to complete.</p>,<p>Getting a chance to talk to a hiring manager is kind of what I'm counting on if I do go the bootcamp route. If the bootcamp promises to instill in me the skills it says it will, then I'm confident that I can convince the hiring manager/recruiter that I'm fit for their position.</p>,<p>Would you say that you've had a hard time getting interviews? Have you been applying only to mid level jobs or have you been considering entry level positions too? Also if you dont mind, could you please elaborate on why you turned down the position you job you mentioned? </p>,<p>So it all depends on the job. I’m getting interviews from analyst roles and anything to do with my past experience (perioperative it/medical technology) but i have certainly been having a harder time getting true data science interviews. I’ve probably only had 3 of the 10+ I’ve had.That being said, my goal is to get my feet in the door. I’m willing to work pretty cheap or in an industry I wouldn’t be particularly passionate about to gain useful ML experience. And some places are willing to hire for that. Mainly places that already have established teams and procedures so onboarding junior people is easier. </p>,<p>The offer I turned down was highly leveraging my past hospital experience but was a java software dev role (of which I have literally no experience) and due to the fact that at this point in time I really don’t want to waste my time doing something I don’t want to do and although it paid great I decided against it. I declined respectfully and if they get funding for a true Ml position they said they’d reach back out. </p>"
