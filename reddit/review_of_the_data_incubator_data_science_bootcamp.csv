"<p>I am pretty happy that I went with Insight. My interview with Data Incubator left a bad taste in my mouth, partly from their unprofessional behavior. I think one key thing from the program is also the networking between the cohorts. It has made it easier for people to change jobs between various companies.</p>,<p>Also, when I was talking to the founder of Insight during the program he mentioned how the incubator founder was pretending to be an applicant or company to get more information about the program before launching incubator.</p>,<p>Yeah, the whole interview process with Incubator feels kind of slimy, and it turns out that's pretty indicative of the feel you get from parts of the program itself. I'm glad you had a good time with Insight, I've heard good things about them.</p>,<p>One meets some good people in the program when meeting and working with other fellows and that's certainly a plus, but the program itself isn't that great. </p>,<p>Honestly the marketing of the program is quite misleading. The training lectures are poorly run and largely a waste of time. You could get better training for free by searching ""data science training"" on YouTube. </p>,<p>The so called ""partner network"" of employers isn't that strong either. My impression (purely observational but seems consistent with others) is that a lot employers have been turned off by TDI. More than a few people in senior data science roles have told me their company has a negative view of TDI and focused on reviewing applicants from other programs, mostly related to slimy and aggressive hard pushes to hire fellows so TDI could collect commissions. Indeed we were under enourmous pressure to just keep spamming employers with applications even where it was clear we weren't qualified for or interested interested in the role. Not surprisingly that seems to have really annoyed hiring partners. </p>,<p>All in I did meet some good people and that's a plus, but in terms of the quality of the training and quality of the careers services aspects of the program it's a big thumbs down from me. I eventually got a position in data science although through connections unrelated to TDI.</p>,<p>Thank you for your insight.</p>,<p>I see what you did there. </p>,<p>Thanks for your review! I've talked to one or two people from TDI, and those opinions seem to echo yours.</p>,<p>For those wondering about how Insight compares (full disclosure, I've had the Insight kool-aid): I will just say that I'm in the final steps of an interview process with a <strong>non</strong>-partner company that Insight put me in touch with, and have been supporting my interview prep during that process. I will note my cohort program ended in March, and I'm still getting support now that it's close to June. </p>,<p>Insight tries to keep a ""fellows first"" mindset, and all of here feel very supported.</p>,<p>Congrats on getting a job! I would be extremely wary of any program that charges any amount of money for throwing you in a room full of people to do data related projects. I think this is where Insight's model really shines - they are careful with admissions, they take care of you, and give you access to a great network.</p>,<p>Don't forget that any program which doesn't charge for you to partake just makes its money by getting a recruitment bonus when you get hired.</p>,<p>I think this is one of the things that Insight is a little bit hush-hush about, but in fact, I think it would make people feel much better to know that Insight only gets paid if they do - i.e. its a mutually beneficial arrangement where you get access to a network of talented people and often early notice of new jobs, and Insight gets  some fraction of your first year's salary for helping connect you with resources.</p>,<p>I think this is a fair review, and as a fellow participant in your cohort, it might be valuable for people to see where we disagree. So don't let what I say seem like I completely disagree with you (I don't), just let it be a different viewpoint on a few items which might help someone here make a decision. </p>,<p>I will say I largely agree about the program's strengths. These are pretty much the things I relate to those people who have been accepted into the next cohort when they ask for my opinion about this.</p>,<p>You mentioned the assignment that was supposed to ""teach"" us SQL. It's not true everyone used Pandas for this; I didn't use it at all, and used the SQL implementation they provided. Still, even if you did just use Pandas, you learned some SQL anyways because the queries are very similar. So to me this was a good way of showing you right from the start that there are multiple ways to do the same thing. I had next to no SQL background and found this more straightforward than using Pandas.</p>,<p>As for learning Scala, I think that was the best week of all of the lectures. Yes, we were asked to complete a coding challenge in a language we'd never learned on day 1, but I don't think the point was to complete it. The point was to force us to immerse in the language immediately.</p>,<p>That said, I do agree the lectures were variable in usefulness, but some of that depended on the subject. The usefulness of a given week of instruction depended both on the instrucor(s) teaching that week as well as the material.</p>,<p>You can't expect to get much more out of a ML lecture than the basic idea and its implementation. Whereas, for instance, in a lecture about Scala, you had the opportunity to learn something about functional programming itself. In the former case depth (learning the math behind, say, a support vector machine) is not available in that time frame. But in the latter case, the depth (the functional programming paradigm) is available, and at the point we got this we'd been doing so much in Python already we had a chance to understand the abstract concept of a functional programming language.  Much like in the first week with SQL, you could also do everything in Python (PySpark) instead of Scala, but that wasn't really the point of forcing Scala on us. The point was to encourage us to teach ourselves new tools, and these tools include languages. I did everything in Scala that week and it helped give me the sense that I could learn a new basic tool well enough to do a serious project with it in a short amount of time.</p>,<p>I don't think being locked out of CRM access is in any way infantilizing. DI makes their money from placing people with jobs, so locking you out from new communications with employers isn't really in their best interest from that perspective. Still, they need some mechanism by which you could prove yourself during the program. After all, they need to be able to vouch for you to their hiring partners not just that you passed their extensive screening process, but that you are able to show a minimal amount of competence with the tools you are supposed to learn.</p>,<p>I disagree that the soft skills lectures were condescending. I think I understand why you might have reacted that way to certain things said in the lectures (the tone could sometimes come across as ""exasperated""). But you have to remember that not every comment or suggestion in those lectures is aimed at you specifically. It's clear they've had candidates who needed much more work in this area, and the lectures reflect that. The soft skills homework was all very good. </p>,<p>I also never felt pushed to apply for a job I wasn't interested in. My attitude towards them approaching me about an opportunity was that it can almost never hurt to just have a conversation with someone, even if on paper you aren't sure about the position.</p>,<p>As for hiring partners, I agree that they are not distributed evenly throughout the country/world, but this is to be expected - building a network depends on building human relationships. If you are concerned about jobs in a particular geographic area, this is something you can ask them ahead of time. I did, and they answered honestly that they didn't currently have any partners in the location I was interested in.</p>,<p>One last thing that a lot of people say around here (and elsewhere), and is something you mentioned in your post: the notion that one can get a job in data science without a program like this. Yes, it is possible to teach yourself everything you need to get a job as a data scientist. The number of people who can actually come up with a program and follow through with it themselves successfully is pretty small, though. Still, merit itself isn't enough to get a job - you need people to introduce you to the right people who can give you a job. It's easy to dismiss networking, because it sometimes seems random, but it's still enormously important.</p>,<p>Thanks for your perspective! Hopefully this is useful for anyone that comes across it to balance out my perspective :)</p>,<p>Thanks for the review. I wonder how long it will take for a real good program to emerge. I've talked a few program managers trying to give me the hard sell on their pricey master's programs yet haven't heard anything good about them.</p>,<p>Do you have your YouTube project suggestion? Do you mind sharing it?</p>,<p>Hahah, well, this is incredibly embarrassing (a rushed video taken from a hostel while jet-lagged in Japan), but this got me to the semi-finalist stage: <a href=""https://youtu.be/Nh32584D5Rk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://youtu.be/Nh32584D5Rk</a></p>,<p>Don't assume my video is a gold standard, I think I got in despite it not because of it. I get the sense that there isn't a huge amount of weight placed on the project video suggestions, so don't worry too much about it - just make sure there's a coherent sounding idea behind it.</p>,<p>Thank you 
:)</p>,<p>I'm pretty new to Data science. I started doing some kaggle projects. I applied for several companies but all I get is rejection. I don't know what should I improve to get a entry level job as data science?!</p>,<p>What's your background? Without having any idea what your background/experience is, it's hard to say what you would have to improve to get a data science position</p>,<p>I got my bachelor in computer science then my master in mechanical engineering and I'm about to be done with my phd in mechanical engineering. Currently job search in mechanical engineering is not very good and since I love programming and train myself on some data science tool and do several project with python and postgresSql. </p>,<p>I'm sort of reluctant to finish my dissertation since I don't see any motivation to finish it. I tried to make my resume in a path of an data science toward engineering applications, but I really don't care what application I get a job. </p>,<p>Having a PhD helps quite a bit. If you're this close, you might as well finish it.</p>,<p>Bootcamps are helpful partially because they connect you with employers so you get a better response rate and partially because they get a line on your resume that says ""data science"".</p>,<p>You said you applied to 'several' employers. I'm not sure what 'several' means to you, but expect to send out a lot of applications. Initial responses might be really low, like only one response for every 10 applications, if you're just cold applying to postings. That's just the nature of things. If you're in a decent sized city, it shouldn't be hard to find a lot of job postings, so just keep applying. Don't be discouraged if the response rate is low, and try to learn from any interviews you get.</p>,<p>Thanks for your comments.  As someone that isn't pursuing a phd but a masters, Data Incubator seemed like an interesting option since they do make exceptions.  I'm not sure how I like the requirements though - specifically needing some project work on.  If I knew to work on, I'm not sure I need a bootcamp for that.</p>,<p>Coming up with a project might not be as hard as you would think - just find some data you find interesting (data.world or kaggle), and come up with a question about it. Your proposal can be pretty simple, and you can build on it. As I mentioned in another comment, I don't think that much weight is put on the project proposals in the application process.</p>"
