"From what I've read, the (non data science specific) coding bootcamps are only worth it if you go to one of the $16000 on-campus intensive programs.,Has anyone had any experience getting a job using one of these? Am I just fucked because of my criminal background?,Whether or not DS bootcamps are worth it, your issue will be the ""thorough criminal history."" I'd strongly suggest going to your state or counties workforce partnership office and discussing it with them. Living in a state where 7 year reporting of criminal convictions would help, but I'm not entirely sure about all that.,My county employment services place was basically like ""you're screwed kid, maybe we can get you a shitjob"" that pays about the same as mturk and plasma...,So it really is just my criminal history? That's what I thought My family keeps saying I'm just not trying hard enough.,I actually know a couple guys who work in tech and have felonies. But once again, it'll only happen if you have ONE blemish in your past, if it was from many years ago, and you've been a productive member of society since then. ,So it's not impossible...,Does your criminal record prevent you from moving abroad or accepting US student loans? Because for the cost of a $16000 bootcamp you could get a masters in data science in the UK from any number of universities, and the US government provides graduate loans for most UK schools. Something to think about...,Can you point me in the right direction for applying to graduate school in the UK? Is there some blog where someone else has done this perhaps?,Saw your criminal history. Most, if not all countries will deny you entry.,Its pretty simple man, you apply just like you would at a US school, but you usually don't need a GRE score for UK schools. The two major differences are that you need to sort out your visa (I'm a dual citizen so I skipped this) and you normally don't apply for European schools until a few months before the start date of the program.,Try to get a job at a startup, probably your best bet.,
Take a look at angel.co,I second this.  ,The one I've heard good things about is Insight Data Science, which is free.,What kind of criminal background do you have?  Recent felonies?,Basically yearly assault, resisting arrest, or shoplifting charges for the past 8 years. Only 4 convictions and all misdemeanors.,It might not sound bad, but the consistency and violent nature paints a bad portrait apparently. I'd be better off if I got convicted of selling drugs honestly.,Also I only have 2 bachelor's degree so I don't qualify for Insight.,I like someone else's suggestion of getting a masters in a diff country with cheap tuition.  I think that's a bettter use of your time and money.  I can't imagine what the boot camps will teach you in a couple of weeks that's worth the money and I think a grad degree will really help reset the clock on your thin job history.  ,Also I agree looking into startups to get your foot in the door is a great idea for someone with an unconventional background ,I might also suggest talking to a good lawyer for advice if you are really worried about your history interfering with job stuff,Lawyer said there's nothing I can do about my record but wait it out for 7 years. Little known fact: ban the box states still do background checks.,Don't you need references to get in to a Master's program? How would I get those with no job and without being in school for 6 years?,Many ms programs don't actually, especially the professionally oriented yearlong ones"

,  ,This is an archived post. You won't be able to vote or comment.,Hello all,,Does anyone have any experience with Rutger's Data Science bootcamp/ certificate program? ,Info can be found here: ,There's tons of information of the Coding Bootcamp, but I wasn't able to find many reviews on the Data bootcamp/certificate. I'd appreciate any insight/experiences you can share. Thank you.,I was also interested in that program, but I am current Rutgers undergraduate student who got into Rutgers MBS 4+1 program with concentration of analytics. I was hoping that program will help my career but then advisor from MBS told me that pretty much program is similar to MBS program, so I decided to not to do it. If you want degree and deeper study, I would suggest you to do MBS program rather than certificate,I'm actually curious about this too since I want to go into data science. $10,000 is a lot though, but I don't actually know how that compares to other bootcamps. ,Here are some reviews. They seem positive: , ,Yes, but none on the data science camp.,I'm interested in the data science bootcamp too, but am worried about the lack of reviews.  I especially want to brush up on my previous MySQL and Python exposure.  "
"Fun Fact: UCI is the largest UC of it's size!,Material unrelated to UC Irvine or damaging to community health may be removed at the discretion of the mods.,Have a concern? , (Remember: the mods are students too, so allow at least 48 hours for a response).,I'm considering going back to school for a B.S. in data science (after working in the advertising world for 4 years). However, I'm living out-of-state currently and would not be able to enter UCI's data science program until Fall 2019. In looking into this, I found that UCI Division of Continuing Education has a bootcamp for data analytics. ,Normally, I wouldn't be tempted, but the person I talked to said the last class has you present to companies that are looking to hire. I'm finding little information about how helpful this class is (it costs $12k) and how many people are actually hired out of the class. I've seen some reviews, but most say it's helpful from a learning standpoint and don't say whether it helped them land a job. Granted, I'm not expecting to switch fields like this without going back to the start of internships/entry-level, but desiring to know the best way to essentially start over. Any input is helpful!,Also, here's the course schedule:

I went through the interview process, where they only asked me 2 questions (how would you look for a book in a library, and why you're interested in the course). It only lasted 10 minutes. For $12K, I was suspicious. It seems like they let anyone in, even though they had the whole interview process and everything. I declined their offer (I got in). ,So I'm taking an online data analytics class through the same school (UCI School of Continuing Education), which is astronomically cheaper! ,Thanks for your reply! I hadn't come across the online version through the same school--glad you mentioned it! I'm going to look into it, especially if it's cheaper."
"Yeah, that's the impression I've gotten as well. But from what I can tell, they are looking for people who have significant experience doing data science (effectively) during their PhDs or postdocs - people who could probably already be data scientists even without the fellowship. They say that anyone with a STEM PhD and a technical background is welcome to apply, which is true, but as I understand it you're not likely to actually get admitted if you don't already have the right mix of experience.,This is exactly right. Insight is a networking program, not a bootcamp.,I second this. I attended Data Incubator and had friends do Insight. Both are free if you're accepted, but I would say Insight is better based on what I've heard.,Some general advice from someone who attended a software engineering bootcamp, taught at one for a while, and now is a DS/ML hiring manager who's interviewed a bunch of people from DS bootcamps:,The bootcamp is just a platform for you to learn. Your outcome is highly dependent on you, and how much you do above and beyond whichever platform you choose. ,That said, the programs I've seen the best interviewees from are Insight, Galvanize, and Metis (very small sample size on that last one though).,Thanks for the detailed response here. Question for you if your willing. What are your thoughts from a hiring perspective on previous employment before the bootcamp? I ask because I work in sales and have been considering a data science bootcamp (I have a mech eng undergrad), but worry my background will decrease the likely hood of finding a first job in the area. ,I look for people who excelled at their previous roles. Since bootcamps do best for people who are self-motivated and driven to succeed, I look for those traits in peoples' previous roles. Not too concerned about what that role was. ,Thanks for the reply. Just one question: what color vest are you wearing right now?,Insight is the best overall, but is actually a fellowship (not a bootcamp). They only take top PhDs. Not really any solid bootcamps at the moment. Once the bubble pops in a year or 2, the top tier camps will remain.,I would avoid Galvanize, General Assembly, Springboard and Thinkful. Many of their graduates have incredibly underwhelming pre-bootcamp experience, like paralegals, tutors and middle school teachers. We have gotten our fair share of applicants from bootcamps grads.,DataCamp is pretty good.,+1 to data camp! ,I thought about using data camp to get some new skills with my math degree.,Thinkful has a data science program that just launched this year, I've been super happy with it so far. Their web development program is one of the most highly rated of them all. ,Web development and data science are 2 totally different subjects. Being good at one does not mean they will be good at the other. Report back when you get a data scientist job.,Also, I highly doubt they are a top rated web development program. Their website clearly states they have a 36% graduation rate. My local community college is slightly better. ,Overall, the quality has been top-notch. I'm really digging it so far. ,This was the exact question i was going to ask. Mods, can this be stickied or put into the sidebar?,This was the exact question i was going to ask. Mods, can this be stickied or put into the sidebar?,EDIT: ,Bootcamps are listed under ""Questions around schooling choices"" right now. ,Ah. I misunderstood the stickied thread. Thank you for the opportunity for clarification. ,Has anyone tried Springboard's programs at all?,They've got some student stories/testimonials here: ,Their data science career track seems new and I couldn't find testimonials -- but they do have some testimonials for the foundations & intensive course. I saw their curriculum and that's not something that's unique. But mentor 1-1 calls seems more interesting! ,The mentor part seems like it could really be beneficial. I am, however, always skeptical of testimonials for a product on that product's website. I try to find other reviews but haven't seen many in organic environments (like Reddit comments). Mostly on review sites."
"Yeah, the whole interview process with Incubator feels kind of slimy, and it turns out that's pretty indicative of the feel you get from parts of the program itself. I'm glad you had a good time with Insight, I've heard good things about them.,One meets some good people in the program when meeting and working with other fellows and that's certainly a plus, but the program itself isn't that great. ,Honestly the marketing of the program is quite misleading. The training lectures are poorly run and largely a waste of time. You could get better training for free by searching ""data science training"" on YouTube. ,The so called ""partner network"" of employers isn't that strong either. My impression (purely observational but seems consistent with others) is that a lot employers have been turned off by TDI. More than a few people in senior data science roles have told me their company has a negative view of TDI and focused on reviewing applicants from other programs, mostly related to slimy and aggressive hard pushes to hire fellows so TDI could collect commissions. Indeed we were under enourmous pressure to just keep spamming employers with applications even where it was clear we weren't qualified for or interested interested in the role. Not surprisingly that seems to have really annoyed hiring partners. ,All in I did meet some good people and that's a plus, but in terms of the quality of the training and quality of the careers services aspects of the program it's a big thumbs down from me. I eventually got a position in data science although through connections unrelated to TDI.,Thank you for your insight.,I see what you did there. ,Thanks for your review! I've talked to one or two people from TDI, and those opinions seem to echo yours.,For those wondering about how Insight compares (full disclosure, I've had the Insight kool-aid): I will just say that I'm in the final steps of an interview process with a ,-partner company that Insight put me in touch with, and have been supporting my interview prep during that process. I will note my cohort program ended in March, and I'm still getting support now that it's close to June. ,Insight tries to keep a ""fellows first"" mindset, and all of here feel very supported.,Congrats on getting a job! I would be extremely wary of any program that charges any amount of money for throwing you in a room full of people to do data related projects. I think this is where Insight's model really shines - they are careful with admissions, they take care of you, and give you access to a great network.,Don't forget that any program which doesn't charge for you to partake just makes its money by getting a recruitment bonus when you get hired.,I think this is one of the things that Insight is a little bit hush-hush about, but in fact, I think it would make people feel much better to know that Insight only gets paid if they do - i.e. its a mutually beneficial arrangement where you get access to a network of talented people and often early notice of new jobs, and Insight gets  some fraction of your first year's salary for helping connect you with resources.,I think this is a fair review, and as a fellow participant in your cohort, it might be valuable for people to see where we disagree. So don't let what I say seem like I completely disagree with you (I don't), just let it be a different viewpoint on a few items which might help someone here make a decision. ,I will say I largely agree about the program's strengths. These are pretty much the things I relate to those people who have been accepted into the next cohort when they ask for my opinion about this.,You mentioned the assignment that was supposed to ""teach"" us SQL. It's not true everyone used Pandas for this; I didn't use it at all, and used the SQL implementation they provided. Still, even if you did just use Pandas, you learned some SQL anyways because the queries are very similar. So to me this was a good way of showing you right from the start that there are multiple ways to do the same thing. I had next to no SQL background and found this more straightforward than using Pandas.,As for learning Scala, I think that was the best week of all of the lectures. Yes, we were asked to complete a coding challenge in a language we'd never learned on day 1, but I don't think the point was to complete it. The point was to force us to immerse in the language immediately.,That said, I do agree the lectures were variable in usefulness, but some of that depended on the subject. The usefulness of a given week of instruction depended both on the instrucor(s) teaching that week as well as the material.,You can't expect to get much more out of a ML lecture than the basic idea and its implementation. Whereas, for instance, in a lecture about Scala, you had the opportunity to learn something about functional programming itself. In the former case depth (learning the math behind, say, a support vector machine) is not available in that time frame. But in the latter case, the depth (the functional programming paradigm) is available, and at the point we got this we'd been doing so much in Python already we had a chance to understand the abstract concept of a functional programming language.  Much like in the first week with SQL, you could also do everything in Python (PySpark) instead of Scala, but that wasn't really the point of forcing Scala on us. The point was to encourage us to teach ourselves new tools, and these tools include languages. I did everything in Scala that week and it helped give me the sense that I could learn a new basic tool well enough to do a serious project with it in a short amount of time.,I don't think being locked out of CRM access is in any way infantilizing. DI makes their money from placing people with jobs, so locking you out from new communications with employers isn't really in their best interest from that perspective. Still, they need some mechanism by which you could prove yourself during the program. After all, they need to be able to vouch for you to their hiring partners not just that you passed their extensive screening process, but that you are able to show a minimal amount of competence with the tools you are supposed to learn.,I disagree that the soft skills lectures were condescending. I think I understand why you might have reacted that way to certain things said in the lectures (the tone could sometimes come across as ""exasperated""). But you have to remember that not every comment or suggestion in those lectures is aimed at you specifically. It's clear they've had candidates who needed much more work in this area, and the lectures reflect that. The soft skills homework was all very good. ,I also never felt pushed to apply for a job I wasn't interested in. My attitude towards them approaching me about an opportunity was that it can almost never hurt to just have a conversation with someone, even if on paper you aren't sure about the position.,As for hiring partners, I agree that they are not distributed evenly throughout the country/world, but this is to be expected - building a network depends on building human relationships. If you are concerned about jobs in a particular geographic area, this is something you can ask them ahead of time. I did, and they answered honestly that they didn't currently have any partners in the location I was interested in.,One last thing that a lot of people say around here (and elsewhere), and is something you mentioned in your post: the notion that one can get a job in data science without a program like this. Yes, it is possible to teach yourself everything you need to get a job as a data scientist. The number of people who can actually come up with a program and follow through with it themselves successfully is pretty small, though. Still, merit itself isn't enough to get a job - you need people to introduce you to the right people who can give you a job. It's easy to dismiss networking, because it sometimes seems random, but it's still enormously important.,Thanks for your perspective! Hopefully this is useful for anyone that comes across it to balance out my perspective :),Thanks for the review. I wonder how long it will take for a real good program to emerge. I've talked a few program managers trying to give me the hard sell on their pricey master's programs yet haven't heard anything good about them.,Do you have your YouTube project suggestion? Do you mind sharing it?,Hahah, well, this is incredibly embarrassing (a rushed video taken from a hostel while jet-lagged in Japan), but this got me to the semi-finalist stage: ,Don't assume my video is a gold standard, I think I got in despite it not because of it. I get the sense that there isn't a huge amount of weight placed on the project video suggestions, so don't worry too much about it - just make sure there's a coherent sounding idea behind it.,Thank you 
:),I'm pretty new to Data science. I started doing some kaggle projects. I applied for several companies but all I get is rejection. I don't know what should I improve to get a entry level job as data science?!,What's your background? Without having any idea what your background/experience is, it's hard to say what you would have to improve to get a data science position,I got my bachelor in computer science then my master in mechanical engineering and I'm about to be done with my phd in mechanical engineering. Currently job search in mechanical engineering is not very good and since I love programming and train myself on some data science tool and do several project with python and postgresSql. ,I'm sort of reluctant to finish my dissertation since I don't see any motivation to finish it. I tried to make my resume in a path of an data science toward engineering applications, but I really don't care what application I get a job. ,Having a PhD helps quite a bit. If you're this close, you might as well finish it.,Bootcamps are helpful partially because they connect you with employers so you get a better response rate and partially because they get a line on your resume that says ""data science"".,You said you applied to 'several' employers. I'm not sure what 'several' means to you, but expect to send out a lot of applications. Initial responses might be really low, like only one response for every 10 applications, if you're just cold applying to postings. That's just the nature of things. If you're in a decent sized city, it shouldn't be hard to find a lot of job postings, so just keep applying. Don't be discouraged if the response rate is low, and try to learn from any interviews you get.,Thanks for your comments.  As someone that isn't pursuing a phd but a masters, Data Incubator seemed like an interesting option since they do make exceptions.  I'm not sure how I like the requirements though - specifically needing some project work on.  If I knew to work on, I'm not sure I need a bootcamp for that.,Coming up with a project might not be as hard as you would think - just find some data you find interesting (data.world or kaggle), and come up with a question about it. Your proposal can be pretty simple, and you can build on it. As I mentioned in another comment, I don't think that much weight is put on the project proposals in the application process."

Thanks!,I would be highly, highly suspect of a Data Science bootcamp. Moreso than I am of a Software Engineering bootcamp. You might be able to learn at least how to program in a bootcamp. I don't think you'll learn that and the math behind Data analysis though,It depends on what kind of data analysis.,If OP wants a job doing relatively simple ETL with some end-user reporting, a Data Science bootcamp would be an extremely expensive and unnecessary way to prepare for that.,Most data science jobs (data , vs. data ,) require a mathematics-based BS (CS, Math, Stats), and prefer advanced education (MS, PhD).,So I agree. No. A boot camp is not a good way to go.,Where do graduates of data science bootcamps end up?,I'm just one dude, but I've never seen a resume cross my desk with a Data Science boot camp listed. I've never heard it brought up in interviews.,I don't know if that's meaningless or telling.,Data science generally requires such a high level of education, anyone qualified to teach it will have much better options than running a bootcamp.,Usually people teach because it's their passion. People normally don't teach because they don't have any or option.,I don't think that's true. Every teacher I know went into it because they had no other option. ,Look, data science is , People who are good at it just aren't that likely to be running bootcamps. If they do teach, they teach at universities. Ok, you might stumble across a unicorn, but you've got to be wary. Most (if not all) of what you run across will be trash.,[deleted],Yep. I think there are some high-quality code bootcamps out there and I think they're a good way of learning quickly, but data science? Eh, that one is a lot riskier.,Just because you haven't encountered any, doesn't mean there aren't. I knew someone that dropped out of software engineering working at one of the Big 4 to teach community college. People don't just go into teaching because they don't have any other options. ,Sorry, we're going off track here but I find that to be a very arrogant thing to say. Teachers are undervalued in our society and they deserve our respect. ,When did I say I didn't respect teachers?,Don't get sidetracked by the moral argument. I'm just describing your actual probabilities of finding a good course.,Don't do it, go college suffer for two years and have a job for the rest of your life.,I would be more convinced if you could provide me reasons or why you think this,Two years ago I went to coding boot camp which is similar to data science and started going to networking events, meeting recruiters and the industry officials. Many recruiters which I talk to will not hire anyone from any kind of boot camps. Their number one preference was a technical degree. Now I am pursuing CS degree and I have recruiters waiting for me to graduate so they hire me. ,Just remember there is no shortcuts in life go the long route and you will be happy with it. ,Moreover, data science is hard and you need several months on subject in order to understand it. Our brains can't process a lot of information in one day which coding boot camps offer. ,[deleted],Well what if I have a computer science bs degree and was looking for a software engineering job that works closely with the data science team. Would a bootcamp be useful in that case?,Go on Kaggle and work on improving your rank directly. Data science is shifting so quickly that you're better off looking at the problems companies need solving directly, and deriving a ""lesson plan"" for what you need to learn to solve them yourself.,It's a plausible track - one guy got hired at DeepMind with a Bachelor's and less than a year's actual work experience because of his Kaggle rank. He now works with the NHS detecting eye anomalies.,I hope someone is able to give you some first hand information.  Unfortunately, I have only looked into them a bit and my google-fu would add little to the conversation.  I left the military some time ago and was looking to use my GI benefits to attend one of these while I was between contracts, but was having a tough time 'trimming the fat' on the massive list of bootcamps available these days.,Is the bootcamp you were looking at also on Course Report? If not, I would look elsewhere. ,Anyways, Microsoft has Data Science training through edX and/or Udacity. There is also , course by a data scientist turned educator, which can be purchased for $10 during promotional sales.,Bootcamps sometimes have negative stigmas attached to them, but many developers have gone through them and eventually remove them from resumes after being employed. Your success will be the willingness and hard work you put into the camp, usually by completing projects that solve a business problem that can be showcased on a resume.,What is course report? And meh, I'm not really a fan of online learning. The way I learn, I will need that human connection.,Right, I know that sometimes people have different learning preferences. I'll actually be taking classes myself after two years of self teaching. ,Course Report is basically a Yelp for bootcamps.,If you need human connection in order to learn, it might be worth considering whether you really want to attack something like Data Science. It's incredibly abstract. The vast majority of your education will be reading abstract formulas and papers."
"  If you have attended a bootcamp do you feel it was useful, did they inflate their placement / jobs stats, ddi they over-sell and under-deliver? ,Can be good but shouldn't be seen as comparable to formal education. 4 week camp doesnt = 4 years undergrad + maybe more,Can anybody comment on the advantages of boot camps as networking tools?,A lot of the advice I see on this sub for aspiring data scientists is to create strong networks with people working in the industry. Do these boot camps provide an opportunity to meet people or work on small projects to build a portfolio/experience? ,I think this is essentially the only use of them.  Meeting lots of people.  You just can't learn much in a serious way in 2 months.  But you can meet 50+ like minded people that you'll know for a long time.    The other big benefit, at least for the insight program, is that you get to see demos from 40 companies, and really understand the different variety of roles and companies available.  This was pretty opaque when coming straight from academia. ,Got my current job as a result of networking through the NYC Metis Data Science bootcamp.,Companies that hire grads from the bootcamps know what kinds of skills to expect from you so they're more likely to hire you. I work with two graduates from my program and it's great. ,what was your background before the bootcamp?,Easier to just link to another comment I made: ,I'm seeing a lot of people on this thread that have completely different levels of skills, so as someone who graduated the Metis DS bootcamp, I will try to clarify what I've seen:,Source: graduated Metis bootcamp, got current job through network, has a BS in journalism and working on MA in Data Journalism, working for global marketing company ,I'm a teaching assistant/mentor for a couple. The only reason I would go is to get interview practise. The content is does, pass the snuff test when compared to a formal, in-class education program.,Completely wrong. ,We hire from bootcamps, but only PhD's that have experience with doing original research. Doesn't matter if it's STEM, social science, etc, but PhD + bootcamp is a pretty good combo in my opinion.,How general is this sentiment? I'm a biology PhD student with roughly two years left, and the state of academia combined with my realizing I prefer data analysis to data collection has led me to conclude I want a data science job after all of this. Is a bootcamp the way forward once I get this doctorate? (I'm going to finish, that's for certain),Take advantage of resources at your university. In addition to normal classes that are open to graduate students in all disciplines, mine has groups running short courses that are free or inexpensive on Python and R every semester, Software Carpentry workshops, and interdisciplinary data analysis hackathons and symposiums. I get emails all the time about these. You might also investigate research partnerships with students/faculty in statistics or CS: you have data, they have methods and programming skills, and you could learn a lot by collaborating with them., A Master's in Stats from a reputable institution would be appropriate & more than sufficient. But to have a PhD in , subject i.e. social sciences is rather ostentatious. Someone with a Master's in Stats from say, a top 10 program like UC Berkeley, is going to do far better than someone who did their PhD in Sociology from a no name school or even top ranked program for instance. ,Now if you're looking to get yourself into industry – a bootcamp is a good start, imo, but you should at the very least, get your Master's in Statistics from a quality program like UC Berkeley's 1 year Master's in Stats program.  ,Of course, a PhD + bootcamp is a good combo, but it's not cost-effective considering it's an extra 2-6 years of work after the master's doing menial labor in a lab oftentimes & the opportunity costs of losing income during those years outweighs any potentially higher salaries you may get as a PhD which really is only like a few thousand bucks/year. Let's say a PhD takes another 4 years after the master's (for a total of 6 years), well that's about $500,000  in gross earning potential (roughly $300,000 net) being lost. ,Btw, , had his MBA and a Bachelor's degree & self-taught otherwise. , – do the boot camp to learn hands on skills - but couple it with a Master's in Stats from a reputable institution & you'll do just fine. Reddit.com, is heavily biased by a few readers, but it's a small sample that doesn't truly represent the demands or expectations of employers particularly in the Bay Area. ,And for the record? I make more than several PhD data scientists do because I have been in the industry far longer & ultimately, what got me a job at Apple was skill. There's no real secret besides some talent, hard work, networking, and grit. ,I get the feeling his comment assumes a candidate happens to be switching to data science from their academic field, NOT that they pursued a PhD specifically for data science.,Calm down bro...The fact that we hire PhD's for research data scientist positions doesn't mean we don't hire anyone else. That's a huge leap you're making there. If I like eating chocolate ice cream, that doesn't mean I don't occasionally eat vanilla or strawberry ice cream.,Also, a lot PhD's in sociology, psych, etc have solid stats training and we need their expertise in causal inference and counter factual analysis. Most PhD's in engineering disciplines don't have this and undergrads certainly won't,When you say ""we only hire PhDs"" how does that not imply that you don't hire anyone else?,Bullshit. Gimme a scrappy math or statistics undergrad any day. Less ego too. ,Ok, take me pls. I even have three years of data sciencey experience. Seems everyone disagrees with you because I ain't get any call backs.,Pm resume ,Speaking as someone who has interviewed people for Data Science roles, if someone was presented to me and their only background in DS was a Bootcamp I wouldn't even give them a second glance.,And if they had background + Bootcamp, I'd wonder why they bothered with the Bootcamp in the first place.,What about someone with a STEM or programming background that isn't specifically DS? ,I'd consider someone with programming  and/or STEM background over a Bootcamp any day.,What about someone with a STEM background, who can program, and did a bootcamp? I have a math ba, took the first job I was offered, even though it wasn't data science related. How do I get in to the data science scene?,Would you consider it a mark against someone with that non-DS background if they did a bootcamp?  I've considered bootcamps before, and coming from a physics background this is the first time I've heard someone suggest there's a negative connotation to them in the interview process.  Wouldn't want to handicap myself if it's a scarlet letter of some sort...,""And if they had background + Bootcamp, I'd wonder why they bothered with the Bootcamp in the first place."",It's a signaling mechanism. Same reason why people get MBA's...a useless degree, but it signals that they are somehow of a certain caliber. ,Does it though?,Based on their salaries...,Whether it does or does not isn't relevant? What matters is that many perceive that it does.,Wow, that sounds a bit harsh?,I agree with him. You aren't going to get the stats background necessary for data science from a boot camp. Boot camps are kind of jokes tbh, maybe for crud app code monkeys they are fine, but for a real position they are useless. These look like they are focusing on teaching skills to people already with a background, so I am not sure why the people aren't just learning it on their own.,I went to a web development bootcamp that is among the best and I did not do well enough to get employed, partly because of personal issues I couldn't cope with - but everyone around me did amazingly well.,One guy I worked with got a senior front end developer at a company you'd recognize - he had a bit of web design experience, that's it. Most had zero experience and got software developer jobs (not 'Jr') at established companies averaging about 100k in the Bay Area. It's true that the only one got a job at Microsoft (one of the titans) and he was well above most of us. But the best bootcamps are pretty darn good.,Web development is not the same as data science.,If anything, a bachelor in Computer Science is usually an over-kill for most of the web development. It's not necessarily easier, but it's definitely less theoretical. On the other hand, a bachelor in Computer Science is likely to be not enough for data science position, never mind a bootcamp.,relative to what? a traditional academic institution? 
Any comparison would be difficult as there would some bias due to the ""best bootcamps"" only taking good candidates. So those candidates may not have succeeded because of the bootcamp, but because they were allready solid candidates.,OK but surely that same bias exists in ""the best"" academic institutions.,Same direction of bias, but not necessarily the same magnitude.,Oh yeah I would be surprised if the average IQ was much below 130 there, same as at a top school like MIT or Caltech. My point is just that they aren't all a joke, and most who attended certainly weren't prepared to get a coding job before it.,It is quite a bit harsh, misguided, and unrealistic. I personally attended Zipfian Academy in 2014, work for Apple, and my undergraduate degree was in physics. See my other post. ,You absolutely don't need a PhD – several of my classmates in Zipfian had Bachelor's degrees or working on Master's or have their Master's & are working at top companies in the Bay making good money doing interesting work. Industry experience + skill gets you solid jobs. Some companies may discriminate, but since demand > supply, it's a seller's market for data scientists & engineers. ,Having a PhD is nice but it's not cost effective unless you are adamant on getting it for personal interest. Getting a PhD solely for looking better to impress a few folks here on , or b/c they said so is a bad move career-wise & also a recipe for undue stress and misery. Sure having a PhD is great, but is spending another 3-5 years in lost income opportunities worth it for a slightly higher pay raise? I can tell you personally that my salary, stock options, and bonus rivals or is greater than those of many of my peers because of the skills I bring to the table (which I learned on my own time, through Zipfian, MOOCs, and in work). Is a PhD in Sociology, Psychology, or Music as good as a Master's in Statistics? No – there is a tremendous amount of FUD being spread around on this subreddit that you need a PhD, and it's complete bollocks. To be fair, is a PhD in Stats, Physics, or Comp Sci. preferred? Sure. Do you think you're eager and/or smart and/or disciplined enough to do one of these types of programs? Probably not. There is still , of work that needs to be done that doesn't require a PhD in Physics or Stats to get done & the odds are that the random PhD you encounter probably won't have the skills to solve that problem in the first place.,This subreddit's egotism that PhDs are the end all be all needs to tone down quite a bit. I have worked with brilliant PhDs, and PhDs who couldn't make the grade. It all ultimately boils down to the individual. ,I've just graduated from a top university with a BA in Physics, and I'm looking to get into data science. I'm currently doing some MOOCs. Is it worth paying for the certificates? And how much value do you think the bootcamp added to your application?,IMHO you should probably get a master's degree first. There are a lot more relevant job openings that are open to ones with a master's degree, and it usually doesn't take forever to finish. You can do the MOOC later.,I guess clarifying this what if they had a background in programming but not DS? ,I have never met anybody from a DS boot camp so I cannot comment on them.,Sounds like you interview for a bad company then or you don't know how to interview for skills. ,One thing that's come on my radar is the bootcamps often publicise their 2014 placement rates, when they had far fewer students. I'd guess the success rate through bootcamps in general is significantly lower than the figures they claim.,WRT the comments around PhDs etc - a PhD in a , discipline is massively useful, but those kind of guys (Math, Physics, Econ, Stats, CS, Engineering ...) will be more than capable of growing their data science toolkit on the job.,A Doctor of Sociology will have a much harder time picking up the stats-based side of things, and a 12-week bootcamp isn't going to change that worth a damn."
"It's a lot of cash but it seems immersive. Where are you getting this consensus? ,That's just the impression I've developed mostly from articles and comments around reddit; I'm by no means an authority on the subject.,Maybe take a look at ,.,If it's a certificate you want, go for it. Though I don't know what the value is.,If you want to learn about Data Science and its content, look for (free) online courses and try out things with free software or trial versions.,I've basically gone through my whole career so far just teaching myself things, but a graduate degree proved that sometimes getting connected with a community is worth the money. Plus I suck at online classes. Will try to take this course and report back in May-ish. Thanks y'all"
"Which program will be easier to get into?
Which program is more highly respected by potential employers?,*A little background info - I do not have a strong computer science/math background, but I did take two graduate level quantitative analysis courses (which I loved) while getting my MPA that used Stata. I also have limited experience with Minitab, SQL, and Java. I am also working on the JHU data science courses through Coursera and will be attempting to learn Python in the upcoming months. ,Can't speak for GA but do know that Metis gets some experienced people (phd, etc) and their graduates go to some well known places.,source: got into metis. chose to do self taught instead because $$. ,I'm assuming that you're using this to get a junior level data science role.  If that's not the case, my recommendation would be different.,There's some bias against bootcamps on this subreddit.  If you're having problems with self learning, you should do one.  Ideally, you could do everything for free, but some people need a push, accountability of the classroom, helpful guidance / teaching, etc.,The worst thing would be to fail at learning on your own and quit after investing significant time.  From your post, it doesn't seem like you'd have issues learning on your own.,That all said, if you think that you'd have to pick between the two, I'd choose Metis.  There's a stronger emphasis on producing a portfolio, which is going to be an important part of demonstrating your competency.  If you have a PhD (I believe required), absolutely choose Insight.,I'd like to add, that as someone who probably could have gotten a job without the bootcamp with a few months of self study, what I am getting out of the bootcamp is a lot of job help, which turns out I needed more, so the bootcamp is good for someone who needs familiarization with the tools of the trade and interviewing/professional help. I have never had a job outside of academia... so I had no idea what to expect!,Graduate of Metis here. In short, boot camps are absolutely worth it , However, you have to be aware of your past experience and adjust your post-camp expectations accordingly. ,In long: ,Graduated with a BS in Journalism, two years of grad school for data journalism (basically data science with a focus on visualization and less stats.) Decided about a year ago I didn't want to be a journalist anymore, chose to take my data cleaning skills into the tech space. Applied to Metis and went, even though my programming and stats skills were probably on the lower end of the bell curve, compared to the rest of the students. Got out, took a crappy summer job then ended up building databases and basic DS dashboards as an analyst at a top-3 marketing company. ,If I had not taken this camp, I would be grinding away at a $28-k a year job, now I make more than double that and life is great. I'm not a ""data scientist"" - I would need a PhD in machine learning to get those roles at Google, and a lot more experience to have that title even at a smaller company - but I'm the most ""data-literate"" person on my team and the demand for that keeps growing. ,Definitely do Metis. They take much higher-quality applicants than GA and the job opportunities are better., Data Science, as we know it, wasn't around 10-15 years ago and 10 years from now there will be careers in fields that we have not even thought of yet.   Your interests and perspectives on life also will change as you get older.  It could mean a career change at 35, 45, or 50.  Sometimes that career change may come because of a firing or layoff.  Would attending a bootcamp in order to learn a new field be the wrong choice in that situation?  I think not.,For the love of God, do not do General Assembly,What makes you say that?,I would instead recommend a course on udemy if you want a full course for cheap. They are $10 for the next few days. Jose Portilla makes good ones, I took his R course and I learned a whole bunch.,But will employers consider someone who learned through MOOCs?,Yes, for junior roles they will consider someone who has MOOC experience.  It's all about whether or not you can do the work or pass their technical interview.,source: have hired for junior analyst / data scientists in the past, know that other hiring managers feel similarly,When you see applicants who have MOOC experience, how do they generally present that on their resume? Does it matter if they have paid for the course to get the ""certificate""?,Either under Education or Other Education.,No, it doesn't matter.,I know that udacity.com has a high employment rate, but it is expensive (possibly as expensive as a bootcamp). However, it's much more about displaying your competence through projects that you publish on github or other places, as well as having a good interview.,I actually teach the Udemy course, I wouldn't say the certificate is super valuable, but my courses try to get you to a point where you have multiple projects you can show to potential employers. Pm if you have any questions,Another Metis grad here. I have also taken part-time courses at GA and done plenty of MOOCs.,Biggest advantages of Metis over GA or MOOCs:,Curriculum - Metis is really well planned. I graduated about a year and a half ago and have used nearly everything I learned in a professional setting since. You could get many of the same skills through MOOCs, but not as quickly, and there may be some skills you don't even know that you should learn – for instance, most DS courses focus on the machine learning & statistics aspect, but what about data infrastructure? automating tasks? planning and building a project end to end? presenting your findings to a live audience??? Metis teaches all of the above. I've also heard from students of the GA data science bootcamp that the course felt a bit slapped together, that GA developed the course quickly to compete with schools like Metis.,Career support - For MOOCs this is non-existent. GA does some but it doesn't come close to Metis. The career team at Metis takes the time to get to know all the students and supports you with introductions to employers, networking opportunities, resume/cover-letter writing workshops, interview practice (both technical and soft-skills), salary negotiation workshops, etc. etc. etc. (the career team is awesome). Most alums that I know now work as data analysts, data scientists, junior data scientists, or data engineers. It all depends on your previous experience, strengths, and interests.,Are bootcamps worth it? Absolutely, changed my career, changed my life.,I looked into other bootcamps before I chose Metis and I felt that they were the best.,Do not do a bootcamp. It is a waste,If bootcamps are a waste, what do you recommend doing instead? ,Disagree. Metis changed my life and career ,Don't do a boot camp. If you don't have a mathematical/quantitative background you'll need to develop that first. Kahn Academy has some great courses on Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability, and Statistics which form the foundation of every method a data science practitioner uses.
In my experience, the bootcamps focus on surface level usage of libraries like sklearn, statsmodels, pandas, and keras but don't help you build depth in quantitative problem solving which is the actual job. Those candidates consistently fail out of our hiring process for this reason. I haven't seen any evidence that they add value. The Insight program might be the exception due to their tight relationship with employers, but it is also free.
This might also help: ,Another Metis grad here.
Reasons for Metis over General Assembly:,Coming from an undergraduate degree in economics and realizing that teaching myself to code would only get me so far, Metis was the perfect choice to pivot my career. I'm now making more money than I thought was possible at a young age and working as a Data Scientist.,I would 100% go for Metis,As far as boot camps go.  Choose Metis.  It is accredited and backed by Kaplan Learning (Test Prep).  It is no fly by night operation.  The instructors are good and they do try and give you some of the theory behind the ML algorithms.  They use Python which is the standard in the tech industry.  Also, the career office , get you prepared to go out there and find a position(one their strengths).  Add to that, the alumni network is a strong one which also helps in finding jobs.,Please read this before you decide you want to attend a Data Science bootcamp ,Hell, I am currently in GA's bootcamp. In the class, there is a range of people in this class. A few people who advanced degrees from top universities in physics and math, a few people who don't have a technical background. This is a very good class. My background is in physics and computer science (I hold an advanced degree), and for me its a very fast way of applying what I already know to the tools of data science. I am not learning a lot of concepts, but more of how to use specific tools. Some people are learning concepts, because they havent had multivariable calc, or linear alegebra, but for an entry level job (as an analyst) I'm not sure thats important. Most people here had little programming experience, and I think thats the biggest struggle. The reason I decided to join is because the instructor here (I'm not in NYC) is a very good data scientist and has leading technical roles for big DS companies. What I will say is that GA tends to help out its strongest students and kind of let the weaker ones fail. If you are constantly getting top scores on your projects, doing inventive stuff, the outcomes team goes full stop for you. When they talk about their statistics on jobs, they give an arbitrary cutoff, which has to do with how skilled you are in a program and how much effort you go to find a job. Personally, as someone who has been an academic for their entire career, being immersed in the industry driven program is helping out a lot. For someone who a strong technical background who has been in industry, I think MOOCs and self learning is sufficient. For me, I was a bit lost because there is so much information out there on how to transition to data sciences that I decided to pay for this bootcamp. Its curated, has relevant experiences, and the instructor here is sharp enough to answer any of my questions. He's even helped me go beyond what the class is learning now since for someone with an advanced degree (or CS background, probably) the class moves a little slow. "
"Related Subreddit :,This is an archived post. You won't be able to vote or comment.,The job market in my field is small and locational. Thus I feel lucky to be employed in a place I like, and to be getting the salary I am. However, the work is boring, it's hard to change jobs, and data science work seems so much cooler. ,I've been casually studying data science and machine learning for ~8 months, but it doesn't feel like I'm making significant progress. I want to quit my job and study full time. I have some savings but I'd still struggle to make it past 6 months of no pay check. If I did the bootcamp, I'd defer payment to avoid cutting into my financial runway. ,The bootcamp is three months long, costs $16k, and say their graduates average offer is $90k within six months of graduation. They do not guarantee a job, though they apparently have strong connections to help you along. ,I've thought about slowly starting Master's in CS coursework, and aggressively job hunting as soon as I feel adequately skilled. I know a Master's degree in CS is desired by some employers anyway, and I know the bootcamp credential doesn't count for much. But I wonder if my BS eng degree is enough credential already (assuming I get my skills up to par), and whether I could cut down on opportunity costs by sooner getting a data science salary flowing. ,I think it comes down to risk/reward (one year at the higher salary could more than cover the bootcamp cost), so I'd appreciate any opinions on the data science job market and how I could fare.,TL;DR: Could I be competitive for data science jobs on the west coast after going through a bootcamp? Is a bootcamp ever a better choice than a Master's degree? ,Why would you pay for a boot camp like that? There's plenty of data science boot camps where the companies , then get you interviews with the companies. It's basically a fancy head hunting agency. You need to be on your game to be in that situation, of course, but it's a heck of a lot better than forking out $16k for a 3-month boot camp with a big ""maybe"" of getting a job at the end.,IMO, go after a Masters and really focus on building your ML, data wrangling, and programming chops. Work on and openly publish side projects to show off your skills. Soon enough you'll have companies knocking on your door.,As a person who hires data scientists, I couldn't agree with this more. Don't pay for a bootcamp. The top tier bootcamps are paid by companies (they collect a fee from companies that hire their graduates), and are the ones I typically consider hiring from (they're also highly competitive to get into). Many of the paid-by-student bootcamps feel to me like they're taking advantage of students who want a career in a hot new field by promising they'll be able to switch careers in a few short months of work, which just isn't realistic (at least for the kind of data science we do — for data analyst roles, it may be).,A CS masters is a good thing, but CS degrees are by no means prereqs for data science positions — having very strong mathematical and programming skills are, though.,[deleted],Insight and Data Incubator are the two that come to mind, though I'm sure there are other great programs.,How about NYC Data Science Academy?,Do you have a link to any of those bootcamps? The only one I know is Galvanize and they charge 16k,Oh really... I didn't know there are company paid bootcamps. I'll research that sort of thing. My justification for this specific bootcamp was its convenient location, and the expected salary bump would cover the dollar+opportunity cost within a few years. ,I agree I should do a Masters/PhD at some point, but I'm a little hesitant to commit to that much time to data science without knowing what full time work is like. But I don't see a better option to gauge that, and I figure it's a rather versatile skill-set anyway. ,To clarify: It's not just one company that pays for the bootcamps; several companies pitch in for the opportunity to interview with prime candidates.,I can tell you right now that the paid bootcamp you're looking into is probably exaggerating their numbers, or they're hiding the fact that a large portion of their attendees don't get hired.,Yeah, I assumed there's probably some stat-manipulation throughout the process. ,But their numbers are really strong: $115k median, 93% placement rate (better than I remembered). Even if they're somewhat curated, I wonder if I still wouldn't end up in a better situation than what I'm presently in. ,What's their drop out rate?,Asking the all-important question. I bet that's how they make money. ,So if I did the Master's, should I expect to pay  tuition? I've seen so many people saying to never pay for STEM grad school, but I don't know if that applies to people changing fields.,Usually you can convince your employer to pay or help pay for your Masters as long as it's related to your job, unless your employer sucks (in which case you should move on for greener pastures).,Theoretically I can get $5500 reimbursed annually. But I'm not sure I could convince my current boss these classes are job applicable. I'm definitely keeping a lookout for the greener pastures.,The advice applies especially when we're talking about PhD level grad school (and really, it doesn't make sense to pay for your PhD because would you pay to do your work now, instead of getting paid for that? PhD , working). For masters, it's a bit hard to say, entirely up to you to decide, I guess.. ,No,no,OMG, no. How do you even know you won't get half way through and hate this subject too?,I can hear it in you. You think you hate your job because it doesn't pay enough and it's boring. The reality is, you're only paid 70K because you hate the job and you're bored there. You've mixed up the cause and effect.,The best way to learn is to apply. Pick a fun toy project you feel you can build with your current level of knowledge. (If you can't think of any fun projects, that should be a strong indicator that you're going in the wrong direction.) You will undoubtedly run into problems along the way, exposing holes in your current level of knowledge. You will have to find places to ask questions. You'll learn where to get good answers. Some of those answers will expose even greater holes in your knowledge leading you further down the rabbit hole. Once you actually complete the project, it will still be a stupid toy project, but if it actually works and you can demonstrate it, you can get hired.,I'm happy with my current pay.

"I know that I want to move towards a career as a data scientist, the only thing I am concerned about entering one of these programs is the cost. I would have to break my current lease, spend a lot of my savings to move from my current location to NYC, and likely apply for a loan to pay for the program and my living expenses for the 3 month bootcamp. Is this a foolish idea? I am mostly interested in going to a bootcamp because without doing so I don't think I'll ever transition fully to a career I enjoy. I have been self studying several programming languages and have some projects I've completed, but I know I need a project based or academic setting to push myself to learn. In my current job I work 60-70 hours a week regulary on salary, so I know without quitting my job I'm not going to learn as much as I need to to move to a data science career. Any advice is appreciated. ,don't do it. this sounds like a bad idea all around. you could spend one tenth that and have the best udemy/coursera/etc plus aws/azure and probably still have money left over to interact with thought leaders. if you have a master's in ME you are smart enough to learn this on your own. also find a way to cut back working hours. easier said than done, but that would be a huge help.,This needs to be higher. There's nothing you will learn in a bootcamp that you can't learn online. If you're worried about not having time next to your job, then maybe only quit your job and dedicate yourself to something like a coursera data science series. Then you at least don't have to pay for the bootcamp and won't have to move either. ,too many negatives imo:
1. you'll be in debt
2. you have to quit your current job which means lost of income
3. no guarantee of income after completion of bootcamp,The no guarantee of income would definitely be a deal breaker for me. Money is too important for me which is why as much as I want to do a developers bootcamp, its a no go.,Why are you trying to change fields? With a Masters in MechE, you should be able to find plenty of interesting jobs without moving into data science.  ,If you're hellbent on changing fields, then I would recommend that you change jobs to find something where you can work and study on your own, or take part time classes at a university.  TBH, bootcamps are not well regarded because their graduates were either basically capable of doing the work before they walked in the door (but needed a credential to get past recruiter screens) or totally inept and not worth even considering.  A 3 month bootcamp is not sufficient to teach the skills necessary in the depth required to do actual work.,Maybe, as the op says, they want to change fields and move away from MechE, and rather than using hellbent to refer to the career change, they prefer excited,It just seems to me that most people who want to abruptly change fields really want to actually change jobs. OP could probably make more money, and have a better work/life balance if he left his current job.,You have options. You can as other say take a few courses online. Maybe you won't like it. If you like it I would seek ways to use machine learning in your field.,You can also take risk and finish the course. You will meet new people, doors will open. Surely there will be new opportunities. There always are.,Edit You work too much.,I live in NYC and will be entering the field once I finish my PhD. I don't think for-profit bootcamps have your interst in mind. There are a couple that are extremely selective, but free because they get paid by whoever employs their students. They tend to be PhD/Post-doc only though.,I am a data scientist in NYC. This is a terrible idea. I personally don't think the private sector data science bootcamps are good. ,It'd be much better to apply for another master's in Data Science, Statistics, or Computer Science and do this part-time while seeking a job in data science.,Thanks everyone for all the advice so far. One of the main reasons I'm interested in the boot camp is that I'm looking for a career transition that will allow me to move back to NYC. I lived there for several years and loved it, but as a mechanical engineer I've had absolutely no luck finding any jobs, in the financial capital of the world, which isn't suprising. I know I should've thought about this while I was in undergrad, but going through as a mechanical engineer I think my college succeeded at making it sound like a lot more of an interesting career then I've experienced.,I definitely appreciate all of the advice so far, thanks.,I think you're selling yourself short. Where did you go to uni?,Assume 6 months to find a job after you complete the bootcamp.  Can you tolerate that level of debt?  I just finished at Galvanize and have had good luck with the job search, but I am already into my 2nd month of the search.  It just takes time.,An option:
I was an aerospace engineer making $65K/year and I went to data science bootcamp I could afford.
Data Science Dojo - one week off of work & <$3000 if you buy early

To be honest, they hired me, so I am a bit biased. I did find a job in data science- one where I can post on reddit at work. :),I've heard great things about Metis and Galvanize (but this is in SF). You could learn everything by yourself — the real questions is whether you have the motivation to. The network is another big part of the value-add, depending on their partners.,Something I would do is to try and find alum from the schools you're considering and see what their experiences were.,If you do take out a loan, make sure there's a 6 month deferral (ideally). Most programs are 3 months and the job search process tends to be 1-3 months.,If you decide to move forward, check out WeFinance.co (full disclosure: I work there). You can crowdfund a loan and pick your own interest rate, deferral, length, etc.).,TLDR: Talk to alums of the programs, get a loan that gives you enough deferral / payments time to find a job"

I feel misled about what kind of material the focus was going to be on.  What I thought was going to be a program that focuses on a mix of statistics and machine learning turned out to be almost entirely ""traditional"" statistics, like biostatistics and experimental design.  My personal interests, like Bayesian statistics, nonparametrics, and machine learning, are barely available.  It also doesn't help that my program head is openly disdainful of tech.,My resume is okay.  Outside of this program, I have two internships, but I admittedly have no accomplishments from them.  The first was with a large organization where I was the only stats person in my department and had no one to ask questions, so they'd assign me to random tasks where I didn't get to finish anything.  The second was advertised as a statistics research position, but I ended up being the only intern with my title doing nonstatistical work.  I did front-end web development with no statistical component.  I have three other projects on my resume.,I've been applying for a ton of jobs and it seems like the tech industry is off-limits to me.

A lot also seem to want PhDs or 5+ years of experience.,At this point, is it worth doing a data science bootcamp to boost my resume, and if so, which one?  I'm not optimistic about being able to get a job at a company like a Big 4 company or a hip new startup due to my lack of a CS degree, even though I'm able to explain and run neural networks and various classifiers and am getting a graduate degree from a prestigious school.  I just don't want to be stuck at a job where I do ANOVAs and t-tests all day, but it's looking more and more likely to me.,you might want to target the finance industry. they are more open to people without a strong tech background and a strong stats/modeling background. ,are you applying much to jobs? look on linkedin for jobs listing 'statistics' and 'python' or 'java' or 'r' as skills. most will not be entry level, but throw in your resume anyway as they might have other openings they might want to consider you for. ,Thanks for the suggestion!  I'm looking on LinkedIn a lot actually, but there are so many spam postings and I can't figure out how to filter out specific companies.  I'm also looking on the opposite end of the country from where I am.,first of all, don't be discouraged about things. While you may have not gotten the experience you wanted out of your program, a lot of tech companies want people with a combination of statistics and programming knowledge. The data science bootcamp sounds like a good idea, but the point is networking with people from IT companies . I had looked into once upon a time a data science bootcamp that  had people from Silicon valley companies coming in. You probably want something like that.
If that does not work out, you may try to find a research position or internship that will give you the experience that you need.
Hip startups are overrated and you can always get into a big tech company after you get the right type of experience in your resume in your first job.
Good Luck !,Thanks.  The thing is, I'm in the opposite position of a lot of potential data science hires in that I'm very good at statistics, but don't have much programming experience.  Even though I know Python and R, there isn't much that I can show off that proves it.  Also, as someone with a master's degree who will be out of school, I'm not optimistic about internships and I'd honestly rather have a full-time job.  But I'll have to figure it out.,[deleted],That's what I've been trying to do.  I'm working on a project now and it's on my resume, but I'm not sure how ""interesting"" most tech companies will find it., ,This sub is for machine learning ,Yeah I know, but I figured this sub would be more likely to have statistics people crossing into machine learning.  Thanks though.,Do post on , too!"
"I recently graduated from the Denver Data Science Immersive program with Galvanize, and I loved it and highly recommend it! As far as I can tell, Galvanize has an acceptance rate of around 20%, and General Assembly is one of the easiest to get into: 40%. Things are changing fast in education and bootcamps but acceptance rates can be a good thing to note (Ivy League Universities are ranked based on the lowest acceptance rates- it is a crude measure, and sounds snobby, but one which captures the high demand of the school- it ensures that it has a high reputation, which can be important for finding a job).,I was first trained as a scientist, and we comment about how in the universe, ""there's no such thing as a free lunch"". So if other programs are letting in more people, then something has to give. It seems like the entering knowledge base must be relaxed, which then means that the pace and depth of a high-acceptance school is slow and shallow and that fellow students wouldn't be able to help you as much. This definitely wasn't the case at Galvanize- there, the students help each other learn almost as much as the staff! We formed a pretty tight group and we were exposed to common techy group-based problem solving strategies (the day-long real-world case studies were awesome). We do paired programming too. ,Since everyone entered with a firm grasp of the basics, we could go really deep and make our own neural nets and clustering algorithms from scratch. This helped us learn in a deep manner and prepared us well for interview questions.,As far as getting a job, I think employers mostly want someone who has proven that they have done quality work which will help their company. Galvanize has a strong focus on the capstone project and case studies, and learn-by-doing attitude with excellent career services job hunting staff which help you humble brag about your hands-on knowledge and portfolio in order to speak to what employers want most. Things are changing fast, but at least for now it seems like employers would rather hire a Galvanize grad with an impressive portfolio and hands-on problem-solving abilities which meet their needs than a fresh statistics masters university graduate who knows all the theory perfectly, but hasn't been exposed to Spark, Github, programming, and the many real-world considerations necessary to a business which integrates machine learning into their existing web platforms etc. ,I applied to 20+ jobs, got 6+ phone interviews, 2 take-homes, 2 in-person interviews, and 1 offer which I accepted... all in just 30 days of graduating (and I love my job!). Most people take longer, but have found at least side-gigs 6 months out. The high Galvanize placement percentage actually seemed fishy to me at first, but once I failed the entrance exams and had to do more self-teaching for months to get in, and saw how we learned basically a semester's worth of info each day... then it all made sense how 3 months could help a cohort get nearly complete placement in 6 months. My chemistry job hunt: 300+ applications, 2 phone interviews, 0 in-person interviews, 0 good jobs, 0 help from university staff. It was scary to make the switch, but I'm glad I did! Other bootcamps are probably great too, but I think Galvanize in the Denver area is highly well-known and respected and excels at connecting people to fulfilling, awesome careers!,I can't find the links I previously found which ranked Galvanize as the best bootcamp. Here's all I can find now about bootcamp rankings, but I'd take it with a grain of salt:
,
Many rankings like this seem to reward bootcamps that are cheaper, like Springboard. I did springboard and some udemy classes to help me prepare for Galvanize and they were great for beginners, but nowhere near as excellent as Galvanize for actual grooming me to be a full-fledged data scientist with a job. My Apple statistician friend who chatted with me as part of Springboard recommended Galvanize and said she knew a lot of people who spoke highly of it. ,The personal stories are lost in such rankings and I notice this ranking has Springboard as one of the best. Of course, as a data scientist, anecdotes shouldn't be used, so I recommend people look for stats on: acceptance rates and placement rates. Good luck! You won't need it!...instead- lots of hard work, Googling and Stackoverflowing when you get stuck!,Dude thank you for your great feedback! Very helpful!,You're welcome! Feel free to connect on LinkedIn and stay in touch. I'm Lance Culnane.,Metis"

,., ,This is an archived post. You won't be able to vote or comment.,I'm currently transitioning from the academia to the private sector and I'm also following my SO for a year! I thought this could be a great opportunity to start learning new skills, especially in the tech business. Do you guys know whether I could find fast-paced trainings in data science / data analytics in Korea ? I know it's a thing in Europe/US, but I don't know if the trend hit Asia already.,There are definitely data science jobs in Korea, but do you speak Korean? I'm sure there are seminars or classes you could take in data science, but I highly doubt they will be in English.,Thanks for the feedback! Would you say that learning korean is a plus or really mandatory? I don't mind spending time learning a new language, but I could also spend that time learning tech related materials.,I would not expect to master Korean in a year unless that's the only thing you're doing for the next year.,Fair enough! I'm probably not going to be fluent, but I'll give it a try anyway. ,I'm a DevOps guy doing some startups out here in Seoul.
There is definitely interest in Data Science and machine learning out here. 
But you'll notice it's behind the stuff in the US (like google, FB, LinkedIn...)
There's actually a ton of opportunity with it, companies like Naver here (Korea's version of Google) aren't doing enough with all the data they have. The opportunity here is great, but the pay doesn't compare to the US.,But I'd say start doing some machine learning or look into IoT with that data science background. There's a lot of interest here in what you can do with data. Training a model to continuously categorize/analyze new data (maybe you're collecting through an IoT network) is pretty valuable now.,Anyway where are you going to be living? Hopefully in Seoul...,Check out the , - it's free and constantly hosts tech related talks, often in English.,Also , is a good spot to find tech gatherings, but a lot of it will be in Korean.,Korea also has , which is like meetup but more comprehensive... And largely in Korean...,Feel free to hit , up on Kakaotalk when you're here and I can help introduce you to people in that side of the tech scene here. ;),Nice, thanks a lot! I'm already proficient with data analytics tools in Python and I've some experience with R. Not familiar with IoT data streams yet, but I've already wrapped my head around ML algorithms. Definitely looking forward to learn about that!,I'm glad to hear that Meetup is well implemented! It's a great tool to meet people. I plan to sit between Seoul and Daejeon, I heard it's not big of a deal to travel from one to the other.,And thanks for the links! We'll get in touch once I'm out there!,If you're transferring from acedemia, you can continue being a professor of whatever here and lecture on the same subjects.,If you are just a university grad, you need Korean skills in additional to high level data science skills.,Yup, I thought about teaching as well, just in case I don't find any data related position. I'll have a look at neuroscience classes ;),Why not do a post-doc or take some visiting scholar position? You wont be able to do much else within a year in Korea. If you were staying long term then academia would be the best choice.,Well, it's always easier to stick with what you know best, but I'm never going to land a permanent position anywhere in the world, so better start getting actual job experience right now :)"
"Why am I doing this? I like making STEM accessible. Plus, practice talking about this will help me interview!,I'm in week 8 (of 12), wrapping up formal instruction and heading into project development/hiring. You can check out my past comments too for some info.,What kind of experience does it take to get in?,
I'm a STEM PhD and have spent the past year really interested in data and data analysis. I've taken all kinds of online classes and started following blogs etc., but I don't have any experience. I am not in a genomics lab, so I'll never get my name on a paper with fancy data analysis.,
My current strategy is to keep learning and get to the point where I can do some interesting data analysis/visualizations, and I guess get them online somewhere. So, is anybody really impressed by these blogs with random visualizations that keep popping up everywhere? How do I get actual experience without going back to school? A data science bootcamp really seems ideal for me. I'll know when I get to the point that I can handle it without embarrassing myself; how will I convince everybody else?,What does it take to get in? Python, stats, basic modeling. I completed Learn Python the Hard Way, already had a good feel for stats/probability, and went through many of Stanford's ML videos. With a little self study, it sounds like you'd be ready for the course. If you already have coding experience, you might be ready right now. Apply and get access to the first coding challenges!,I'm impressed by random blogs! But I'm a student, not a hiring manager. The program has encouraged us to blog- we've heard a number of examples where having a blog has helped past graduates get hired. It showcases your skills, ability to present technical information/communicate, and personality.,Actual experience without going back to school? Hmm. I'd consider building a portfolio and github repository. You could work on kaggle challenges, or develop your own projects from found data sets. Many cities across the US have Open Data data sets, and while my experience is limited to the bay area, there seem to be lots of volunteer opportunities where you can get involved on projects. You could go to data science meet ups- especially for networking.,For anyone interested, here's a series of blog posts (not mine) about the whole 12-week experience: ,Psh - get cracking on your project over doing an AMA! Your code wont write itself! ;),Source: was in cohort 6,I know youuuuu ;)
Talking about the program is good stress relief!,Hi, ,Thanks for doing this! This was very well-timed as I am right on the verge of making the decision to apply to Zipfian with minimal experience and no formal background.,Some questions I have are:
Did you have any projects, final or in process, that you were able to link to in your application?,Outside of the basic needs you mentioned (python, stats/probability, ML), what additional items do you recommend for someone who has free time beyond just the basic MOOCs?,I am currently working as a data analyst and I have the liberty to pursue data science projects at my job for a few hours a day. However, I have also considered quitting my job and dedicating myself full time to getting in to Zipfian. Given what you know about the application process, what would you recommend?,Thanks!,I had no coding/data science projects for my application, nothing on github, and had only taught myself Python for the interviews. I was a more math-heavy applicant, and focused my study on coding while working full time. That worked great for me!,The more python and coding experience you have, the better off you'll be. Have you taken an Algorithms course? That seems to be the most common recommendation, and something I'm going to do as soon as I have time.,If you can start working basic kaggle competitions- even the tutorials- you'll be a step above (guesstimate) more than half your cohort. You could also learn these python tools- pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and sklearn.,Feel free to ask more here, or PM me.,Hey thanks for answering questions about the program! I'm strongly considering quitting my job and taking the galvanize bootcamp in SF.,I was looking at the alumni page, and it looks like the majority of them had a masters/PhD before attending the bootcamp, and/or had industry experience in a statistics or a high level technical field (other than some anomalies like the professional poker player).,My question is: how do people with just bachelor's degrees stand among these other very highly qualified people?  From what I understand, admissions to the bootcamp is pretty selective.  Would someone with a bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering (with very little experience working in the nuclear industry) who goes through the free courses in the ""data science primer"" be a very competitive applicant?,Also, do you have any perspective about the long-term job prospects  for graduates of the bootcamp (as opposed to the traditional applicants to data science jobs)?  How seriously are graduates from zipfian/galvanize taken compared to people with PhD's in statistics and other relevant majors?  I'm concerned that even after quitting my job and taking this bootcamp, I'll still be underqualified for a good math-y data science job.,Thanks again for answering these questions! I'd love to hear about your experiences after going through the hiring process as well. Good luck on your project!,Hey! Sorry, I've been swallowed by capstone-project-creation.,If you can cut the math and have the skills, I don't think the program will care about what degree you have. Getting hired is a different problem that I haven't gone through yet. But seems like there's room to shine/get hired if you can demonstrate skills regardless of degree.,Not sure about your second question at all, or at least, I'd only be able to muse on it and I should be modeling instead. I know graduates get hired with the title of Data Scientist. Beyond that...,good luck!,Update time! Two weeks post hiring day.  ,Companies contacted: 11,
Waiting to hear back from first email: 1,
Companies in interview process: 6,
I turned down: 2,
Turned me down: 2  ,Phone interviews so far: 5,
Scheduled in-person interviews: 2,

OOF!,[deleted],I expect to negotiate on full hiring package- salary, equity, benefits, holidays, wfh, bonus, etc. That said I get the impression that hiring bonuses aren't unheard of, but not especially common.,Uh, I'm in final offer negotiations. Company moved really fast- I first talked to them two weeks ago.,So nervous! Fingers crossed.,I'm just a lurker that searched this sub for info about bootcamps, and I'm here to say good luck! :),Thank youuuu. I just signed a job offer I'm thrilled about on Friday!,I am also interested in experience needed to get in, acceptance rate and the like.  I come from a non-STEM field (applied linguistics with a focus on computational linguistics) but I'm earning a data science certificate online from a brick-and-mortar school.  When i graduate I'll have a thesis under my belt that involves a little data science but I'm wondering if it'll be enough.,An easy answer is to check out the program's Data Science Primer: ,
Your lack of data science experience won't hurt you if you have enough python, a good grasp of stats/probability, and understand the basics of modeling techniques (I used Stanford's ML videos).,I'm not sure of the exact statistic, but I believe they mentioned that they accept around 20% of applicants.,Hmmmm, thanks!  I know a good deal of Python, and I'm learning R and SAS right now.,You're probably set then- I only just finished LPTHW before interviewing, and had no problems!,Oh, also, what was the timeline like?  Like when did you apply, when did you hear back, when did you actually start classes?,I graduate with my masters in May but I'm going to spend spring semester trying to look for a job.  I'm hoping to apply to Zipfian as a backup but I don't know about the timing.,My situation was a little weird, so I can't give you a definitive answer- but it took some time. To be safe, I'd start the application process at least two months in advance of when you'd like to start. Probably more. I started the process about a month and a half before, and the cohort I was hoping for was filled.,You could apply early and defer your acceptance to a later cohort- I don't think they'd have a problem with that, and you could ask when putting in your application. Classes start every 6-7 weeks, so lots of options.,ok thanks!,Is there a particular industry you want to apply data science in? / what problems can greatly benefit from data science?,What kind of interview questions do you get when applying for a data science academy like Galvanize?,I'm interested in Data Science for Social Good and thinking of specializing in geospatial analysis. I don't expect to get to DSSG work right away- I'm looking to gain solid experience first and find a problem type to specialize on.,Interview questions included python challenges (more advanced than fizzbuzz but not extremely so), basic probability/stats, and modeling basics. Little to no in-person questions were asked about my experience or background.,What is job placement like?,The last study they ran had a 93% placement rate. I've seen the data (they provide it when you're accepted), and the number checks out.,I think I'm allowed to give these details...
The 93% placement rate in-field was measured for at six months post graduation. Within six months of graduation the placement rate was lower, but that included folks who had graduated within mere weeks of the study.,We have weekly talks from companies who are hiring and trying to attract talent, and even the mentors we're assigned have been hinting that they're hiring. The question seems to be not if you'll get a job- but if you'll get a more desirable mathy job.,That said, I haven't gone through hiring yet!,Were you living in the area before you started this bootcamp? Every time I hear about these I wonder where people are living while they go through them if they didn't already live in the area. The FAQ for these programs generally don't deal with practical questions like where people are supposed to live, and how they are supposed to pay bills while doing this.,Yup, I was living in the area previous to the program. Housing is... pricey right now around SF. Check out craigslist for current prices (not PadMapper, they lost craigslist data).,The transit system here can enable you to live within an hour's commute of the program and find a somewhat cheaper rent- I live in Oakland and my commute's about 45min door to door.,HOWEVER, they've also opened up programs in Seattle and Denver- if you're flexible on location, you might be able to cherry pick the city with the cheapest cost of living. Tho if you're trying to relocate to a specific area, it behooves you to attend the same.,Hi,
Thanks for doing this, and congratulations on being placed in this bootcamp! I've heard about Zipfian and really wanted to apply for it as well, but I need to learn a bit of python first :),My question is, can you elaborate on the depth of ""basic modeling techniques"" part of the admission requirement? As in, do we have to memorize the actual formulas/derivations of basic techniques like linear/logistic regressions, factorial analysis/PCA, or just simply know when to use which in a particular situation?,The short answer is that I studied enough to know which type of regression was which, to understand general modeling considerations, and to recognize and interpret common modeling graphs. I went through most of the overview topics in Stanford's ML course:
,But note that I'm just a student and can only speak of my experience- I don't know their admission requirements. For those I can only refer you to the galvanize website.,Hey not to be too terribly much of a dick or anything but are you guys basically all Insight rejects?  Is there anyone you know of in your program who got in to Insight but turned it down in favor of this?,Insight is a post-doctoral program, I have but a masters!,So no, I didn't bother applying to Insight.
About a third of my cohort has PhD's, the question might be more relevant for them...,What does your average day look like?,Also, I'm an international student here on an F1 visa for grad school. Are there many international students in the program?,Code for a half hour, lecture for an hour, code for three hours, lecture for an hour, code for three-five hours, go home, try to do the reading or catch up on something, fall asleep, repeat.
Weekends I mostly spend trying to catch up too. There's a lot of material.,There are a number of Canadians in my class- and they tell me there have been other countries represented in past classes. Not sure of visa requirements etc, you'd have to talk to the course directly.,Hey, Thank you for doing this! :D,I have a master in mechanical engineering with little programming experience mainly in Matlab. Right now I'm taking Python coding thru Code Academy and I might take some more programming via Coursera. How much programming do I need to start an application for data science bootcamp? Do I really need to have a degree in computer science?,Is there any other data science bootcamp equivalent to Zipfian not located in SF? (I live in NY),No comp sci degree needed for Galvanize/Zipfian- I only completed Learn Python The Hard Way before interviewing. I also have an engineering masters. The more python/coding experience you have, the better off you'll be, but it sounds like you'd be fine.,Not sure about opportunities outside of the SF bay area, but a quick google search netted me this fine list that might interest you:
,Is there any student in your class that came from another country pretty much just to enroll in that bootcamp? I'm asking this because it's actually what I'm planning to do.,Also, do they use R?,We've got two Canadians in my cohort that came just to enroll, and I've heard that other countries have been represented in the past! Not sure about Visas etc, you'd have to ask Galvanize/Zipfian directly.,No R, it's all Python instruction and lessons.,are you learning things you cannot have taught yourself? ,Yes and no.,I could never have forced myself to do a tench as much in so little time. Having on-site help means I don't get stuck on syntax and data type errors. I'm picking up good coding/work flow habits/tricks off instructors and other students that I wouldn't get on my own. The tailored resume, interview, and presentation help is invaluable. And have I mentioned networking? That's a huge chunk of what I'm paying for.,If I had the motivation and significant time, sure I could find tutorials and teach myself the material on my own. It'd take longer, be much harder, and there wouldn't be a team devoted to getting me employed, so I'm feeling keen about the choice thus far.,Someone asked me to give a brief update on my outcomes from the experience and I can already say something.,I've been hired by Galvanize to stay on as a DSR (Data Scientist in Residence, teaching aide + personal portfolio building) through December. It's a paid position.,I also had luck at a recent networking mixer- found a company that was interested in me, and was asked to submit a full application. Waiting to see what comes of that. Networking == invaluable!,edit: Through December,How large is your cohort?,Could you break down the cost? Is there financial aid/loans?,We had around 23 students, I think the next two cohorts are closer to 18.,For financial info I'll refer you to their website. In brief loans are available, and there's some chance of partial scholarship, but I don't have details: ,[deleted],Hmm. I think that's 7% of graduates who didn't find a job in data science, not who are unemployed to this day. That said, there are folks from my cohort going into PhD programs instead of employment that would account for our 7%. I've only got anecdotal info on this one.,What are the educational backgrounds of the rest of your cohort?,Anywhere from physics or engineering doctorates to bachelors in cs. We had an actuary, a drop out from an economics doctorate program, two or three physics doctorates, the same number of engineering doctorates, and maybe ten folks who stopped with masters degrees. One recent biology doctorate. Very varied backgrounds led to a very varied range of experience within the cohort.,Follow up brief note- three weeks post graduation.,I'm done with the bootcamp for myself, but have been asked to stay on as an associate instructor through December. My classmates are interviewing, doing take-homes, and starting to get offers at the expected rates. It appears to take anywhere from 3 weeks to two months from initial contact to offer with any given company. I'll be starting my full application process mid-Oct.,Do you have any sense for which of the students are tending to get offers right away?  Basically, is the cohort self-selected via the application process for success in the job market?  Or are there students who are successfully making a more dramatic career change by merit of the bootcamp?,I am a mid-career professional considering the upcoming Seattle program, so this is a major consideration for me.  ,Offers right away seem to be going to students with the highest level of interest and activity in the job search. Second factor might be skill/confidence in the material- especially because those of us who aren't as confident aren't as active in the job search. Not sure how to separate that out. Last factor, some companies are slower than others- if you're interested in a specific place with a slow turn around time, it takes longer.,I've made a dramatic career change- from excel monkey/management trainee in a government business environment to an assistant data science instructor. Seems like it's more the norm to be swapping fields than not.,Zoule, would you mind starting a blog on your experiences/advice? I am particularly interested on the hiring statistics from your cohort, as it seems to represent a good range of experience and backgrounds. I am also interested in the longer term trajectory of your career path post-bootcamp (>1 year) and of others in your cohort.,Galvanize has been appealing to me for a few months now, but comments I've read about the exaggeration of hiring rates/salaries have discouraged me from applying. Data science interests me, but if bootcamps get much less credibility than a full graduate program (statistics/compsci/etc.), then I may choose to go that route.,Thanks,Hey, thanks for asking.,I'm on the fence about this- appearances to the contrary I'm a little shy, and linking my real name to details about my current job hunt could risk me a position if I'm too frank about my preferences. And, er, this forum is an easy way to share because I can respond to user questions without having to formulate content. I'm strongly considering your suggestion though, I think it'd be a good thing for Galvanize and potentially good advertising for me.,That said, here's more of an update.,My full hiring day was last Tuesday. I had five especially great interactions with companies.* Two additional companies emailed me and asked me to apply, one of which I'm taking up on for an interview this week. I'm still reaching out to other leads that I made that day.,I'm bowled over (and a little overwhelmed) by how well it's going, I've got at least five companies to follow up with tomorrow.,Looks like things are going really well for you, congrats! I was recently accepted to Galvanize in SF and will be starting this January. While I'm excited, I'm still a little skeptical. 
Have you been impressed with the overall makeup of the class? Do you think they did a good job with screening for experience/knowledge/aptitude?
How do you feel about your instructors?
I've seen a few Linkedin profiles of graduates who look like they have been job-searching for a while, any idea what the reasons may be?
Any idea what % of you cohort gets hired through the hiring day?
Lastly, any advice for preparation before the program and how to succeed during?
thanks!,Congrats! Mind if I contact you in early 2016 to ask about your experiencing? I'm toying with the idea of a data science bootcamp but wouldn't be applying to one for another 7 months at the least."
"It seems to range between having a pulse and having a stem PhD. There stem PhD requirements are probably better quality.,I would be interested to hear the answer too. I'd say basic statistics, SQL and Python at least... Am I close?,Python was the only prerequisite needed for the one I looked into. ,I got into the General Assembly data science immersive with very low level Python and SQL, no background in CS. I didn't take the course since I decided I'd rather do a Masters, but the application admissions test wasn't too rigorous. ,thank you for the input. did you pick up python and sql on your own?,Yep, I went through the codeacademy classes to learn some basics for both. The SQL test was using Wagon, which is a SQL editor. Helps to practice queries. ,Hi I am deciding between GA and Masters as well. May I know which Masters course you are currently taking? And if you don't mind, could you also expand on your decision on taking a Masters over GA? Thanks!,I'm still prepping for the GMAT actually, really slowed down since I'm getting married later this month. But, I'm leaning pretty heavily towards UT Austin MS in Business Analytics. A friend did that program and had high praise. I'm also considering UC Boulder, and Santa Clara. ,The biggest thing for me was that since I don't come from a heavy coding background and I don't have any projects to show, a certificate or bootcamp program would only get me so far. I think those bootcamps are a good help to those with experience that want to hone down their skills, but since I'm doing a career change (process engineering to business analytics/data science/etc) I wanted to get a little more background built up as well as a respected master degree. ,GA definitely was a good program and it could have gotten me some good skills in three months, but 16k is a big investment to not walk out with a degree and the return on that investment just didn't make sense for my case. ,Got it, thanks for the insight.,I have similar reservations and will be going to an info session @ GA next week.,Good luck!,I think you just need to be comfortable with a computer and willing to review some elementary math. everything else builds on those two things.,Bare - A programming language (Python or R preferred) and a college class in statistics and probability.,Decent - Above, plus SQL and work experience as a data analyst or software engineer.,Good - Above, plus familiarity with Linear Algebra and a quantitative graduate degree. "
"While data science as a career is still poorly defined, most data science positions require a strong understanding of research design, computer science, and statistics that you won't get just from undergrad and a bootcamp. Bootcamps need to pick people with a proven track record of scientific expertise, hard work, and grueling hours to maintain the camp's reputation (since they're funded by the companies that will eventually hire their students). That said, an alternative approach to data scientist is to get a bachelor's degree and then work your way up through data analyst type jobs. Boot camps generally place students directly into scientist positions.,My only issue with working my way up is that I don't have much of a background in dealing with data, but I did study math and physics in undergrad :( but I can do research stuff,You'll probably need a lot more experience in a variety of areas before you'll be ready for a data scientist gig, then. Graduate level work in statistics is a common requirement on top of solid data analysis experience. There is no substitute for real world data analysis work. Why not apply to graduate school in any hard/quantitative science field? ,I know, I'm actually looking into graduate school. But after my foolishness in undergrad,  I'm trying to make a more informed decision. I'd like to get experience before committing time and money into a degree so I don't end up with a degree I don't use.,I'd recommend looking into data analyst positions if you want to work before graduate school. Then do some , competitions and maintain a data science blog and github account. Alternatively, look into PhD programs (which are almost always fully-funded and pay a stipend). ,Data science is super hot right now, but it's also not for everybody. The skill set is a union of computer science (machine learning, algorithms, functional programming), statistics (inference, forecasting, parametric and non-parametric tests, etc...), and software engineering. On top of all that, you'll be expected to have a very solid understanding of research design, the kind you'll get in graduate school in a quantitative or experimental science. Most top or senior-level data science gigs are dominated by PhDs and most entry level data scientists will have at least an MA or MS. While it's definitely not impossible to work your way up from BA to analyst to scientist, this is not the common career path. Generally speaking, data scientists do not train on-the-job since the required skill set is simply too big to learn in six months or a year. The on-the-job training for most data scientists will consist of learning a company's stack and possibly a new computer language or framework (if the DS team prefers a standard language). A comprehensive understanding of statistics, machine learning, programming, etc... will be expected before you start.,Bootcamps expect their candidates to have PhD-level coursework in quantitative sciences already and then just fill in the gaps between academia and industry. For example, most academics will have experience with small data sets so bootcamps might focus on large distributed data technologies that companies will expect their data scientists to be familiar with.,Exactly. The experience with measurements helps you understand the measurement aspect of every row of data and not just view it as a vector in R, ,From a practical point of view, it's because the measure used to judge boot camps is the hire-rate, and PhDs get hired more easily. So while there is demand from them, they'll be the only ones served. When that demand is met, they'll have a history of ""success."",This is also true. Look at Insight and youll see the occasional PhD in Machine Learning as if that person needs the program to pivot from industry.,But I can be a worker bee at one of these fancy businesses if they'd just train me. You can still boast while saving money.,It cost the bootcamp the same amount to train whether you have a PhD or any other degree but the PhD usually means a slightly higher starting salary and since some of these bootcamps make money based on your starting salary this is another incentive.,Marketing.  It's a lot easier to boast high salaries and big name companies that graduates are getting/working for. If you're a for profit business, the objective is to maximize profits."
"What advice can you give on how to create a portfolio of projects that might separate you from other applicants? What are things you think you learned in this bootcamp that you couldn't have through self-study through books and MOOCs?,How do your job prospects look?,Well they sure won't look good if you can't tell ""your"" from ""you're"".,So this is the one that costs like 15k + housing, right?,What was your interview process like?  It seems surprising to me that a bootcamp that costs money and accepts people without higher education would have that high of a placement rate into DS jobs.  Although, perhaps the '2/3' figure is including any sort of analytics job, which is much more reasonable.,Do you think the program is worth the cost?,Yep. The interview process consisted of a take home challenge (scrape data from some website, make some plots and answer a few questions about it) as well as a skype interview. There weren't any technical questions in the interview -- they just wanted to know about your background to see if you have any stats and programming experience. The acceptance rate is <30% now, apparently. ,We had a few phD's and a bunch of masters degrees in my cohort. Everybody had some quantitative background. I have a B.S in physics.,I'd say the program is worth the cost if I get a job hahahah. I just thought of it as another semester of college. But it's full time (9-5 every day), you get constant one on one help with your projects, and a bunch of networking / career help. ,What are some of the important skill sets gained from this that you think will help you land a DS career? Also - more project or homework oriented? ,I'm actually going to attend the NYC cohort this Fall.  Did you attend the one in NYC?  Want to share any tips on getting a place?  I might just Airbnb it.,I actually went to the SF one and commuted from East Bay so I can't help you there :/ Good luck!,Have you found a job? What's the salary range you're looking at? Was there much machine learning? ,Yep, just signed the offer letter last week! I think 4 out of the 20 of us have found jobs so far (been about a month). Salaries for a starting Data Scientist in the bay are like 100-110k. You might have to take an ""analyst"" role to start out, though, depending on your experience before the bootcamp. They pay less. ,I'd say the majority of the program was focused on machine learning. Random Forrests,  SVM, Regression, Neural Nets.... Also some text mining techniques like Latent Semantic Indexing. ,I have an ms in computer science but I have taken a pretty in depth machine learning class and nlp class, though I only completed one major project for each. I got accepted into metis but I'm working on my resume and wondering if you think I would benefit from going through with the program to get more projects under my belt... Money isn't an issue also. ,I'm not sure how much you'll get out if it, in that case. You'll already have the programming skills (maybe not in python, though?), and a lot of the machine learning stuff will be review. You'd really be paying for a supportive environment to work on a bunch of bigger projects, plus networking opportunities. But if money isn't really an issue, I'd say go for it, and leverage the advisors' help and your previous experience to do some impressive projects -- you can show them off in interviews and at the end of the program to prospective companies. ,Got it, thanks for the info! Just out of curiosity, what was your background going into the program?,B.S. in Physics with some software experience (software engineer internship, as well as some contributions to open-source stuff). I went to Metis right after graduating. ,Hey! I was just wondering how long it took after the interview for you to receive the notification that you were accepted into the bootcamp. Thanks!"
". Crazy to me that these programs can be this selective with a $10,000 tuition fee.

It's quite expensive in terms of bootcamps, but if you can't afford it, manage the math and programming heavy side of it, it's definitely worthwhile to go to some meetups there.  Some of them even have free food!  ,Just look at their alumni alumni on LinkedIn and see if they have jobs. A lot of them don't, or they get hired by galvanize. I recommend Insight Data Science, which is free. Also they have a Insight Data Engineering program which is also free (and doesn't require a phd),In looking at LinkedIn when I was researching Galvanize, I found quite a few amazing gigs (Facebook, Twitter, Tesla, Airbnb, Uber) as well as a few glorified analysts at smaller companies. ,Galvanize does offer a ""residency"". It's a wayfor a student to a) extend their time learning while b) helping the next cohort of students. ,Source: went to Galvanize last spring. Have a job (not at Galvanize). Overall was satisfied with program. ,Note: Linkedin will show that I have 3-4 months off post Galvanize, but I had an offer early & I chose to not work for that duration."

"If money is a primary concern, I don't think so. The benefits of bootcamps over basic self-teaching come from guided, but limited help, and networking/job opportunities. However, I realize that the curriculum for nearly all of the bootcamps follow a similar format to the free courses (like Udacity's DS and ML courses). ,I would suggest taking a few of those free courses. Then hire someone from Upwork to help/tutor you through 2-5 small and big projects related to your areas of interest or Kaggle competitions. I am currently paying around $35-$70/week total for 2 tutors (one in India, another in Russia to help with two different interests concurrently). I lucked out because these guys are super quality (and affordable).,I prefer my strategy because the guided help is more immersive and personal. The networking & job opportunities are supplemented by joining & creating meet-up/study groups. And lots of folks I know are getting hired in Austin who are self-taught with a portfolio showing key skills. ,You could give it as much time as you want, whether 5 or 50 hours a week. Plus you are still putting money into the effort, which helps a lot with discipline. Also, even basic correspondence with your tutor helps to keep you accountable. ,Thus I am saving $15k while creating a robust portfolio. ,PM me if you want to join our Austin DS/ML study group. We can divulge more of our ways. ,This is great advice.,This is actually a good idea if you can dedicate to regular self-teaching.,One of the major benefits of an immersive bootcamp is the time value of money. Quickly changing ones' career for a higher salary.,If you are not making as much as a data scientist right now and it takes you longer than 3 months to self-study to apply for jobs, the money you are saving is probably less than the money that could be added to your future earnings.,what did you end up doing?,got a job as a dev. learning ds in between."

But there are people who want that amount and find it valuable. ,If you think it through, beyond the initial indignation of charging tuition for education, you might find several other ways that a tuition-first training program still has interests tightly aligned to the alumni.

What would a program need to do to maintain existing partners and attract new ones? ,So cynical! I hope you are talented enough to get the kind of deal you want.

The better the FAQ, the harder we can come down on lazy posters with low-effort OPs, which means a higher quality subreddit experience for ,.,This is an archived post. You won't be able to vote or comment.,Would any of you in the industry be able to glance over the syllabus of this datascience bootcamp ,The syllabus is halfway down the page.,Do you think a college graduate who studied finance +2 year finance experience would be able to get an entry level data science/data analyst position after taking this class?,Data analyst, maybe. Data scientist, no."
"It's entirely possible you could leverage your background to get a job in data science. The boot camp would likely improve your chances, however I am unsure which boot camp it is. I've heard good things about Galvanize but some boot camps may not have a reputation like that.,Data scientists largely mix three skill sets. That is domain expertise, computer-science (informatics mostly), and applied mathematics. It sounds like your CS-related skills may be lacking, so the boot camp and self-study is going to be key.,For applied math, I'd say you may already have a decent background there with the engineering degree. However you will definitely want to study more statistics as I would wager your program mostly taught deterministic styles of math. I am of the opinion machine-learning isn't a panacea and is often misunderstood by people blindly using it. Having the theory to back you up really helps when you decide to start learning ML.,Largely your domain expertise sounds like it's in physical engineering and business/management. That isn't a bad background for your domain expertise component. The engineering degree proves you aren't one of those vapid types that skated through a business program, and the MBA proves you have a foundation in business. ,Domain-expertise largely determines which sector of the economy you have the best chance of working in. Someone that majored in biostatistics is more likely to get a job in health analytics than a electrical engineer, but the electrical engineer has a better chance of working in telecomm or electronics manufacturing. That is in a data science role--companies like Samsung or GE still employ data scientists.,One final note, remember that a data scientist is trying to help businesses make decisions by using the scientific method--data is king in science. I would absolutely suggest picking up some books on the scientific method and problem solving using it. Research common cognitive biases (confirmation, selection, etc.). Research false-positive / false-negative rates and why you might want more of one than the other. Research some modeling theory and decision theory.,Before when I mentioned ""ML isn't a panacea, often misunderstood"", knowledge of the scientific method and how to use statistics in that framework is often why it doesn't work out or doesn't work like someone would expect. Overfitting, or sampling biases can really affect how good a classifier really is. Some folks naively make classifiers that seem to work, but in reality they'd get nearly equal performance by using something much simpler.,Dover (publisher) has some cheap paperbacks on topics related to learning the scientific method that would suffice., Note : I am not saying business types are idiots, but unfortunately many universities offer the equivalent of a degree mill for those programs due to the easy loan money they can grab. Grade inflation and requirement deflation is a real problem due to the student loan system. It's harder to fake it or take it easy through engineering or math programs but these programs are also affected.,Great insights, thank you. The part about data informing business decisions is exactly how I am trying to blend the engineering background with the MBA (I have, previous to the mba, started my own company). The bootcamp is with a reputable school in Europe with guest lecturers from MIT and guys in industry. I would do it precisely to address the lack of CS knowledge.,Thank again.,The decision is ultimately up to you, but my general suggestion to new folks is to stay away from Data Science. Sure, there is a bit of demand in the area of analytics, advanced analytics, machine learning, and so forth. However, adoption has been fairly low. Thus, you end up with few open job opportunities and a large group of prospective data scientists. As someone who has been in the field for 6+ years, this have been going downhill and part of it is because of all the new people who want to get DS jobs. ,Look, you have an MBA. You probably understand finance and marketing. You probably have a comparative advantage within some domain. My suggestion would be to optimize to that and stay away from Data Science,This statement  does not seem to hold up with numbers (,), or my own personal experience. Currently my company is hiring data scientists (engineers, analysts, ect, we actually dont call our data people data scientists, we are an older company.) and we are struggling to find the right people. Literally 1 or 2 promising candidates (that ultimately fail) pop up a month. Part of it is the nature of our work requires some other credentials.  When I was interviewing for other jobs (5 months ago?) I was being pursued by at least 2 other companies, I had to stop applying to jobs so I could keep up with the interview process.  I realize my profile is a bit more in line with what the traditional DS is today (STEM PhD, been coding for almost a decade, a ton of mathematics), but that does not mean the opportunities are not there for new people.  ,The real question is what type of people should go into DS, and what type of people will struggle transition, in my opinion. I personally went through a bootcamp to help my transition from academia to industry, and found that people who came from stem backgrounds have done OK on the job market.  That being said, I live in a big data science market (not SF or NY, but at the next tier).  Where you live/want to live is also going to be important, big tech cities are really where the jobs are. ,Thanks for those replies.
Yes, I think I can get more out of doing my own thing over say a year. I can align it more with analytics for business and through project practice. It's a longer road, but I'll probably get more from what I need and can do my own projects.
And the bonus of earning while I do it. Damn those loans.,I think the field is maturing and segmenting in to several subfields. Data Science is the catch-all name but you have various engineers and analysts all working on data science projects.,In my opinion, data science is a team effort. You rarely if ever will find a single person that has all the skills necessary to do the work. People specialize more than that and the field is too broad. It's time to start using more descriptive terms to describe people working in the field, and I think some companies ahead of the curve are starting to do just that with titles like ""data engineer"" vs. ""data scientist"" or ""ML engineer"" vs. ""data scientist"".,A big problem is there are a lot of people with the title ""Data Scientist"" who are actually more like an analyst or engineer. I had the title ""Data Scientist"" for awhile while I was actually doing more of the data engineering work, however I've transitioned to more of the science/mathematics part now that we have built up a team to support it.,Long story short, companies don't know what to call people skilled in working with data. However I think the , will continue to outpace many other sectors for the foreseeable future. So one may not get a job with the title ""Data Scientist"" but they can still find work doing the math and engineering necessary for data science."
"Currently my plan is to continue applying and if that doesn't take me anywhere in a few weeks then I would begin taking a serious look at these data science bootcamps in addition to building an app that uses image recognition to do something neat. ,I built my resume as a guess for what employers want to see - but i may not be emphasizing or describing my experience the best way I could be. ,again many thanks in advance for any that could help out!,Links to my resume can be found below:,
,I have two different versions - one emphasizes computational aspects and is a 1 pager versus the longer one which uses more general wording and is two pages.  ,I would only use the longer one in Europe where 2+ pages is oddly the norm... and the 1 pager in the USA,From someone who is hiring for a non hardcore data scientist role (and is not himself a hardcore data scientist), this would be my feedback having reviewed a bunch of resumes.,Listen to this episode of this manager tools podcast. 
,And look at this sample resume for formatting/structure:
,Comments I'd make:,All in all, if I was reviewing this I would set up a follow up call. You'd save me some time weaving in the resume when and how you used Python, R and especially SQL.,Edit: Forgot to add: the more resumes I review, the more I realize that formatting ""pretty"" resumes does not matter. The podcast covers it, but forget about whitespace, forget about fancy fonts, forget about decorations. A highly dense resume with lots of concise achievements with well defined outcomes wins every time.,This is good advice. I would also tailor your framing of your activities to data science especially since your positions dont have what other resume might have by people who switched earlier ie did data science internships.,It currently reads like a great finance quant resume.,Yeah, this doesn't look tailored to a data science position.,Personally, I would only note personal interests/activities if they were relevant to the job or if you knew the people reading it had the same stuff in their resume (the latter being unlikely).,If the interests/activities were relevant to the job, it would be even better , you could discuss the activities in a more descriptive, detailed way. For example, if you were applying to a data job in a sports context, you might briefly list some coaching or playing experience. Some places care about interest if it's relevant, and for some areas, it's important to have experience and knowledge in the subject matter. Sometimes these things might best be covered in the cover letter.,EDIT: Added stuff.,Totally agree.,Alternatively, if they are personal activities ,.,For example, I like fantasy football. I decided to start playing with Python the first time around because someone had built a data scraper in Python for NFL stats, and so I used it to build a couple of models. That is something that I wouldn't mind seeing on a resume (i.e., built Python script to process fantasy football data).,I've always felt thats one of those ""hit or miss"" areas where any bright line rule would have too many obvious exceptions to ever make sense.  For example, in OP's resume, he lists something about sailing and raising his puppy.  It takes up very little room in the resume and serves, in this case, to reconnect the reviewer with the reality that OP is a person and not just a resume.  It works in this case because OP has an otherwise strong resume (regardless of whether or not it's a strong 'data science' resume), and like I said, humanizes OP.,If OP had something of a sparse resume, or if OP was depending on the reviewer focusing on one or two specific accomplishments, that personal interjection might either distract from that focus or make it seem like OP was just trying to fill space.,So, what I'm trying to say is that, in the right circumstances, those personal interjections can add just the right 'spice' to the resume recipe.  But, in the wrong circumstances, doesn't add anything at all.,I concur with all of these points.  ,One of the ways I put is to have people think of a resume as building an argument as to why they should be hired to fill the role they're applying for.  That tends to keep them focused on making sure information they list is relevant and applicable.,IMO you have a highly competitive CV - especially if you are fluent in R, Python and SQL for real!,I guess you will find a Data Analyst job very easily, Data Science Job will depends on the onsite interviews.,One suggestion - add some github (or any other) links to your free time projects if you have. Or anything where people can see the actual code you have written...,(Note1: I have currently reviewed a bunch of CVs to Online Data Analyst position.),(Note2: plus if you'd like to work in Sweden as Data Analyst (and not Scientist) pm me :)),It's a pretty good resume. A couple things that stood out to me: ,Best of luck in the job search!,Please take my comments as if they are coming from a peer, and not from a hiring point of view (I am a recent PhD, about to enter the industry).
1. Increase the skills section - focus more on the tools, packages and languages you are most skilled at. Those tend to be starting points for interviews
2. Github link!
3. maybe reduce your experiences which are older (>5yrs),You have a very good background.. I was wondering why you want to switch to Datascience from finance?,From someone who reviews resume: more important than adding skills is to weave them into your experience. Too many people list Python, R and SQL in their skills section and when you ask them where they have used it they will say ""well, I smelled the cheetos that  the Python developer at my old company was eating, so I have some exposure to it"".,If you have used it for a project (at least a class project) list it. If you haven't... don't expect to get a ton of credit for it.,Horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible advice.  That's five horribles. ,Listing packages you've used on a resume is a big flashing neon sign that says ""I took an online course in data science, didn't actually learn anything about doing actual data science, and don't know the difference between data science and ,""  It's basically a nice helpful notification for the reviewer to pass.,Maybe you are right, but this is the advice which I got, and found useful (If I may say getting a job, and number of interviews is a measure of success for the given advice). I am not asking OP to list numpy, pandas as ""skills"". Going through OP's background, I am sure he has many specialized skills which should be listed. ,Are you involved in hiring or application review?,I think my original comment made that clear. I am a DS applicant, and recently got a job. Just reiterated the advice I had received from multiple sources.,You should review the comments on this thread, and all the other threads about resumes, from people that actually review resumes and candidates.,Without variation, the conclusion is that listing packages on a resume is a clear sign that you've done some bootcamp or MOOC, but have little to no understanding of actual data science.  The consensus among people in positions to review resumes and make hiring decisions is that, barring something exceptional on the resume, these applications get put into the circular file.,You might have included this information and been offered a position , that.  However, you have one data point, and the conclusion you are drawing from that one data point is directly contravening the advice of all the management level data scientists that frequent this sub.,Ask yourself if that seems good.,Yes, I totally agree with your point. But what I want to say is, shouldn't one mention specialized packages/tools one is highly experienced with? I want to reiterate that I am not talking about basic packages which are covered in bootcamps/MOOCs. I made my comment based on my assumption that OP will have very specialized skills, which might be useful to a potential employer - maybe from his financial/actuarial experience. ,99% of the time, no.  Rarely/never will having used a particular package or library be the make-or-break between advancing in the interview process and not.  I can't think of a single situation where, looking at two comparable resumes, I would advance one because they listed a specific python library they'd used before.  Furthermore, as the adage goes, ""There is more than one way to skin a cat"", and that's very true in coding/programming.  No one is going to care if you make your visualizations using matplotlib or seaborn, they're only going to care about the quality of the visualization you produce.  ,Or to put another way, given two otherwise identical resumes, but one listed out python libraries they used and the other didn't, would you be able to tell me which one is a better programmer?,Put yet another way, can you think  of a single library or package that would make an interview say to themselves, ""Oh, they used package X at some point before.  Clearly, they are a superior data scientist""?,1) No one cares about your GRE scores.,2) Very little on your resume provides any evidence that you have the necessary skills or experience to conduct data science.  Your resume makes a strong case that you are knowledgeable and experienced in the financial services industry, but outside of the phrase ""monte-carlo methods"", nothing in your resume says ""data science"", and even that phrase means extremely little.  ,3) I don't see any github link on your resume.  IF you are trying to get into data science, you need to have evidence that you can do the tasks of data science.  If you don't have the education or experience to point to, your best way to provide the necessary evidence is a portfolio of projects on a github page.  If you don't have a github page with projects, than what evidence are you providing to a reviewer that you are knowledgable about the processes behind doing good data science?,4) You list ""relevant skills"" at the top, but provide no evidence that you have actually every utilized these skills.  For example you list ""Machine Learning"" as a skill, but nothing in your resume demonstrates that you have employed machine learning techniques to solve a problem or answer a question.  ,4a) You also list ""skills at the bottom"".  Have one ""skills"" section and make sure everything listed is relevant to the position you're seeking.,5) Regarding 4: I'm not terribly knowledgable about the financial industry, so perhaps some of those things you listed as having done in previous positions actually did utilize data science skills.  Given that I, as a data scientist, don't recognize them accomplishments that required utilizing data science skills, how likely do you think it is that a recruiter will recognize them as such?,6) Only list things which are relevant.  For example, are your actuarial certifications relevant to the data science position you're applying to?  If they are, great!  If they aren't...why are they on your resume?,7) For a data science position, listing research is good.  Listing the title of an unpublished paper isn't.  You either need to get that paper published, or at the very least, include a sentence or two description about what the paper is, what you did for it, etc.  ,8) Don't worry so much about length.   With the majority of resumes being electronic these days, no one really cares about length.  A resume should be exactly as long as it needs to be to convey all the relevant information, but should be kept as short as possible by eliminating extraneous or irrelevant words, phrases, and information.  In other words, write your resume concisely (IE don't have two separate skills sections, and definitely don't have two separate skills sections that repeat information.  Don't include informatoin about certifications that don't matter for the position you're applying to.)  Be sure that information about past positions you've held is either very impressive in it's own right, or builds an argument that you've developed the skill set necessary to fill the role you're applying for.,thanks for the generous feedback.   I will be adding a link to projects completed so that the skills can be evidenced ,The format doesn't seem very eye catching, but what do I know, this might be exactly what people want to see. You may want to run through a series of templates though to make sure key points are featured prominently.,As someone who reviews resumes: I don't care how eye catching your resume is. If anything it distracts me from finding the stuff I need to know about you (hint: it's not your graphics design background).,I mean, it doesn't need to be an explosion of colour but I don't see why you wouldn't want to make it visually appealing. ,You can - the person reviewing the resume will likely just not care.,Stats people may not mind or even prefer an austere estetic but it's very important for pretty much everyone else.  Management or a board aren't going to have much patience with you if you take the same approach to presenting info to them. ,a) ""Management or a board"" are never going to be the ones reviewing the resume for a data scientist. First layer review will be an HR recruiter, second layer is middle management. If you made it to the third layer, you likely already have a phone and/or on-site interview scheduled, so your resume aesthetic becomes irrelevant.,b) Very few people will equate the aesthetic of your resume to your ability to present information at an executive level. A resume is not a branding document (unless you are literally in marketing or graphic design). Furthermore, people that will make that conclusion are idiots that you probably don't want to work for.,Again, and I can't be clear enough: when you submit your resume to a company, their only interest is figuring out if you have work experience that would suggest that you can do the job you are applying to. Unless building pretty resumes is part of the description for the job you are applying to, there is very little value in making a pretty resume. More importantly, the ""prettier"" the resume, the more page real estate you are losing to elaborate on your responsibilities and accomplishments, which is the only thing recruiters and hiring managers care about.,I am not an expert on resumes - but the guys at Manager Tools are pretty knowledgeable on the subject. I highly recommend you listen to that episode of their podcast because they make a damn good argument against prettyfying your resume. I used to be on your boat - not after listening to that podcast and , not after having to review more than 100 resumes.,This podcast is a bit long in the tooth in the resume reading software age.,I'm not claiming to be an expert either, but I'd make sure it's visually appealing to the extent that it doesn't hurt all the other aspects. I just don't see the downside and a large percentage of people I've worked with over the years absolutely would be judgemental about those details. ,It seems completely unreasonable to me to write off any opportunities as well just because to heck with people who pay attention to readability. I'd never put the onus on someone else to  read my resume or work so I have some doubts about your approach here.,To each his own.,My advice would still be to not sacrifice content for aesthetics, and there is normally a trade-off between the two."
"Week 3 Results:
many good posts and questions. A few questions left unanswered. A smaller amount of people ignored the post (compared to week 1 and 2) and continued posting career questions as their own separate posts. There did seem to be slightly less posts so we're moving in the right direction.,Please post your questions here instead of creating a new thread. Helps keep the sub clean :),Thread will stay alive until next one so keep posting after the date in the title.,Thanks to everyone for answering questions!,Type of Questions that fit here:,Link to Wiki that contains Questions & Answers from previous weeks:,People who are involved in the hiring process, what is it that makes a resume in data science stand out and move the person on to the next round? I am finishing up a masters degree and in the process applying to jobs. I think I have a good resume but am missing something that gets me noticed for more competitive jobs. So it would be good to know how these things work so I can craft my resume better.  I am also interested in whether your company uses software for the first round of screening and if so is the software just looking for key words or something more sophisticated?,Right - disclaimer up front... it's been a crappy day, so your getting a grumpy answer rather than a happy answer.,Do you have a good resume? no. No you do not. I know this for a number of reasons:
- You are not yet out of university and so have not done or achieved anything yet
- For the first year to 18 months of your first job, you will spend a good deal of time staring blankly at people and asking me, as your manager dumb questions. This is not your fault - you are not taught how to be a useful member of a workforce, you are taught stuff from books.
- You are asking this question on the internet, which means you have not asked a person in the industry you know in the flesh - which means you haven't done enough to know people in the industry yet. ,So... thats where you are now. So, lets look at what you can do differently.,First - show me you know more than algorithms. If I have 20 CV's in front of me all saying "".... I can do a random forest all by myself and I once did a kMeans without spitting out my milk..."" then they are all the same. I'm trying to distinguish from 20 fractionally different shades of beige.,If you say ""I took what I learned at University, and then entered a bunch of Kaggle competition and placed OK, and I grabbed a load of data from [somewhere interesting] and did [something interesting] with it, blogged about it and it got picked up by [someone interesting sounding] then you immediately go to the top of my heap - for two reasons.,The first is that you have proven that you can WORK with data, and not just noodle on a bunch of pre-prepared data your tutor gave you. The second is that you are showing a level of self motivation that very few people show - and in return for removing your thumb from your expensively educated bottom, you pretty much ensure that you will get first interviews at most places you apply.,Both of these things are , more important than knowing the ins and outs of a specific algorithm in the private sector. ,You will spend far longer getting data, sorting it out, rebuilding it, arguing with finance teams about it, arguing with the IT Ops teams about it,  vectorising it and then not punching people when the client rings you after 3 days to tell you they made a mistake and you need to ""give it a bit of a nudge...."" - so, showing you can handle some real world data with it's noise and issues also shows to me that you will cost me less than other graduates.,: Not ""You will make me more money"" - but ""you will cost me less""... the first year of hiring a grad is cost heavy - I have to pay to teach you how to be productive. I recruit you based on what I think you will add in value over the next 3-5 years, not what you will do in Year 1 - because in Year 1 you will either be cost nuetral as a best case, or cost me a bunch of money in the worst case.,The self motivated part is also critical. One of the top 3 members of my team is: incredibly young - almost entirely unqualified ( 3 exams when he was 16 and then kicked out of school), and has a criminal record. Looks wise, he looks like a football hooligan and can be... frank... in expressing his view points. In a loud voice. In the middle of an office...,But... the boy is a total fiend with data. He intuitively ""gets it"" and is incredibly slick with working with it. He's works like a dog all day, then goes home and self-teaches himself so he can work faster the next day. He's better with something like AWK and SED than any of the DBA's or data developers or even Unix admins sitting in my building - most who have been in the role for 20+ years. Not because he is especially interested in them or really WANTS that knowledge - what he gets his kick from is finding anomalies in data ( Well - more likely - ""...finding anomalies in data that people who have mocked him for his background can't, and then rubbing their face in it...."") and to do that as well as he wants to be able to, he needs to be very good with AWK and SED - and so he got his head down and became great at it.,He was a , risk in recruiting, but he had a CV full of stuff he'd done, rather than just things he learned so it was very obvious that there was something special about him.,It's that last attitude which is most critical - desire to pull your finger rout - and the hardest to find on a CV. If you show it to me, I will always give you an interview. If you hint at it, I'll probably give you an interview as well, just in case. ,Oh - and show you are normal. Seriously - you are going to be sitting in close proximity to you team and your boss for probably 10 hours a day for the next few years... show me you are not a robot.,Thank you for the advice.  It is very helpful.  What is the best way to list out personal projects and showing that you are truly interested in data on your resume.  Right now I have it broken down like this:,Coursera On-Line Courses: R Programming, Getting and Cleaning Data, Exploratory Data Analysis, Reproducible Research, Statistical Inference, Practical Machine Learning.  ,Projects:  Personal and school projects in Regression Analysis, Machine Learning, Experimental Design and other topics done in R and SAS can be found at my github page,Kaggle: Username- , Finished in top x% in x contest.,Is this ok or should I be going into more detail about my projects?,Also although I don't have data science experience I was a trader for a bout 6 years so I do have some real world experience and that is taking up a bunch of room on my resume.  The story I am trying to convey is I was a trader -> started learning about basic statistical modeling techniques -> apply it to my trading -> Don't want to be a trader anymore -> Go back to school to change careers.  Obviously not everything with trading translates directly to data science but I am trying to convey that I had real responsibilities and had to employ critical thinking and risk management skills.  But maybe it is more important to talk about my projects on my resume than my trading experience.,Also with the coursera courses do you think it would be better to put it under education or skills?,I'm not sure what I think about coursera courses.,On the positive side, I think it's great that someone pulled their finger out and did them in their spare time. That sets you apart from the people who didn't. But... I know some people who have done coursera courses who quite frankly are dumb as bricks - so I'm not sure how strongly I rate them. ,Either way - they definately don't hurt - so I would list them under education, and the stuff that you learned under ""skills"".,I think the story you are trying to express is an interesting one, but you are missing a detail. A different way of telling your story is: ""I tried to run paper on gut feel, then I had to learn some maths, then I burned out/got canned and went back to school as a Plan B"",Now - that could be absolutely wrong, but if I'm in a bad mood because HR are making me read CV's then I might read into your story that sort of message.,So.... I would spend some serious thinking time about how you position your work history. Assume the reader is a cynic and is in a bad mood when they read your CV and tailor it for THAT reader.,On your other points:
Kaggle - good - keep that.,Projects - this is good. But - tell me about them. Don't write an essay - just a sentence on each one. ""I did {something interesting} with {this methodology} and it was {awesome, as I am a data god} etc.,It's good you have both SAS and R - thats a very employable mix - it gives you access to the banks and big finance companies (the SAS) as well as the other industries (the R).,You get extra points for knowing how to use GitHub - you would be amazed at the number of people who don't know what version control is. But... I may well be reading your CV on paper rather than on-screen. It's great to include the link, but make sure that if there is anything awesome on GIT that you want the reviewer to see, you also comment on it on the CV itself - if I'm reading a paper copy on a train, I can't follow the link.,If you were being very cynical, you may want to consider a ""finance house"" and ""not finance house"" CV. For the finance house CV, I would play up the SAS and good working practice knowledge and explain that Regression is amazing and play down the R, machine learning and Data Science-y stuff.,For the ""non-finance house"" I would play down the SAS, play up the R, and also play up the machine learning side.,If you have one ""covers all the bases"" CV, you might get hit with some personal prejudices. The big finance houses are controlled by analyitics groups who are highly conservative, very SAS orientated and dubious of a lot of the new concepts that are floating around. They get paid a LOT of money to be conservative - it's not a personal choice or a failing. ,Thank you for all this.  It is really helpful.,One more question.  Do you care about cover letters?,As someone finishing up your masters, realize how you compare to other people coming out of school. If you don't have something unique about your background, it's easy to get lost amongst all the other recent grads.,The biggest concern about hiring new grads is that they have a good understanding of the theoretical work, but can't translate that to actually shipping projects that add real value. Therefore, my strong recommendation is to create a public, impressive, side project.,This shouldn't be something you did for school. It shouldn't involve analyzing twitter data. It should be public, and it should showcase your data abilities. ,As a data scientist, you'll be expected to approach a vague problem and deliver insights using data. Go do some interesting analysis on an issue you care about and prove to companies that you can do that. If you do that, you're pretty much guaranteed to get hired somewhere.,Thanks for the advice.  Right now my projects consist of either course work or stuff from the coursera data science specialization but I will start thinking of something bigger and more interesting.  Do you think something from Kaggle is a good idea or should I go beyond that?,What would be the best way to get this project noticed by potential employers?  Just put it on github and include a link on my resume.  I always wonder if people our taking the time to go check out my github.,Paging ,.,You may have already seen this, but his advice seems spot on: ,I am sorry, but I do not agree with a lot of the points presented in his resume.,First problem is the objective statement at the top, that is just a waste of space. Don't tell employers what you want to do, show them what you are going to do.,Putting coursework is a waste of time, employers do not want to see that. The general problem with this resume is that it talks about doing a lot of stuff, but does not demonstrate that he can do tasks associated with a data science job.,Along the same lines,  there is no projects listed on his resume. It's just stuff like ""hey I gave a presentation on text mining in python."" If that is the case explain the problem -> approach-> solution. Don't just do stuff like 'I use python, I'm a Data scientist."" Python is just a tool, the real value is using python to solve a problem. The resume in this link does a bad job conveying that information,For what it's worth, I agree that his resume is not the strongest.  But the blog post I thought was spot on.,I've seen this several times, and it's good to know that he's right by others in the field, but his resume seems so , to me. Given all the other applicants who seem much stronger on paper I'm amazed he gets call backs with that.,The number one feature which seems to determine placement in a data science role is networking from what I've seen. I know 5 PhDs in Physics who were all placed in data science roles and all of them got there through someone else on the inside.,Yup. You have so little information about someone when you are hiring. A little bit of first hand knowledge or a recommendation from someone whose judgment you trust goes a long way,Can you provide some examples of strong resumes?,In my view, , which could be pared down to a very strong resume.,She has everything going for her.,Programming knowledge, like Python, Java and R along with SQL. Also experience with frameworks like Python Pandas or Apache Spark.
I look at experience from working in a team. Self taught people tend to be not so good. I also want to see some drive in the person, maybe they started a web consulting company during their studies or similar.,Using software for screening sounds really stupid, I wouldn't want to work at a company who tosses your resume for lack of keywords. Many of the best candidates we've hired have had shitty resumes that you had to read between the lines to understand they had great experience.,Analyze a publicly available dataset and visualize the results using d3, include that page in your resume and I would hire you on the spot :),When you say programming knowledge do you just want to see it mentioned on the resume and in past roles or are you going into the applicants github and checking out stuff they have worked on?  I have both but I wonder if people even bother going to my github page.,I'm 9 month into my career as a ""data scientist"" and consultant. I graduated from Carnegie Mellon with an UG in Statistics, have taken graduate level classes, and am currently enrolled in Andrew Ng's ML course. My company does federal consulting and has been hiring data scientists like crazy, but doesn't have enough actual data science projects to go around. I think their future in the industry is bright, but they are highly disorganized and as an entry level employee, I don't have access to a lot of the resources, and have fallen through the cracks.  My question is, what is the best way to move forward and become an actual data scientist, given that my main goal is to find mentorship who can show me the ropes, walk me through practical problems rather than me just figuring it out by myself? Would a smaller company or larger company be good for this?  What languages should I ask potential employers to use if I do want to spend the bulk of my working time getting better at this, etc. Sorry if these are ignorant questions to ask, I have no idea what I'm doing but I really want to grow as a data scientist.,For what it's worth, all of the original ""data scientists"" figured it out themselves. You should be thinking more broadly about people to learn from and ways to develop your skills, instead of expecting to learn everything you need from a company / boss.,Sounds like you're going through a bit of a rough transition to the working world in general. Don't worry, lots of people, especially people who were very successful in school, can get caught up when starting their careers, since the environments are so different. Overall, it's not on the company to mentor you, it's on you to figure out what you need and make sure you get it.,On the career development side, I would focus on specific skills you want to develop, and then figure out how to develop those specific skills.,I would look to get some friends who are programmers, data scientists, and business analysts / marketers / finance people. Then, when you get stuck on something, you have people you can ask for help. That's the secret to actual career development you don't learn in school.,Feel free to PM me if you have further questions.,If you specifically want a mentor choose a larger company. In a smaller startup you will learn a lot but have to teach yourself, they won't have enough people/time/resources to devote to a mentor type program although you may develop a natural mentor relationship with someone there. With a degree from Carnegie Mellon in stats I would say you have a very stuttering background for getting a permanent position on ds somewhere. ,That's what I had originally thought, however, the company I'm at now is very large and I've fallen completely through the cracks that I get 0 mentorship. Thanks for your reply.,Yeah I can definitely see that happening too. You might want to look into meetups and see if you can make a connection there. A true mentor ends up being a really personal connection that goes beyond being at the same company. Best of luck!,Been to over 10 meetups here. Community is solid. Thanks again!,You should definitely work for a larger company for a year. That would teach you a lot. You will experience great tools that will be great when working at smaller companies because you know what's out there. Hopefully there will also be one or two gurus in a certain field like machine learning or in a language. As for languages, ""data sciencing"" is a very creating process and therefore you need a language you can be creative in, like Python, R or Scala. The company should also have a good SQL interface to their data like Hive, Redshift or BigQuery. Spark is a framework thats really up and coming because of its simplicity to use.,What should one's salary expectations be for a Junior Data Science position in, say, the Pacific Northwest? Since Junior Data Science positions aren't that common it's unclear from Glassdoor. Data Science positions seem consistently around the 90-110 mark, but a junior position is more entry level, so my expectations are lower.,Greythorn conducts an annual salary survey, and according to our figures for 2016, you're pretty spot on for a junior data scientist position. If you'd like to see that in context of other roles/experience levels, you can request a copy of the report here: ,Thanks for your response. This is really helpful.,I'm finishing up my undergrad in Chemistry. It's no longer something I want to do for my career. What steps should I take to transition into the field of Data Science? Should I do Statistics for my master's?,Finishing up a Masters in Bioinformatics. My masters had about 7 statistic classes including SVM and general ML. My bachelors however was biology. I will most likely do a one year advanced masters in data science to put 15 more data sciency classes under my belt that are heavy in practical. ,However, what do you think my chances are to get job with just my initial masters. My database and machine learning classes where very in detail but only theory. So I feel lacking in the programming department. Although for my thesis I program in R all day. What do you guys think? ,Sounds like you're qualified to start applying. ,I am just worried because in ML class we didnt learn any practical  implementation (we solved algorithms by hand or using prolog).  My SVM course is pretty practical but I still feel like i would be expected to be excellent at implementation. I mean I know the theory but I would need time for getting a feel of implementation. ,Did you not apply SVMs in R during your thesis?,I don't think it's really beneficial to spend another year in (and thousands of dollars on) grad school. Theory is the difficult skill here, not implementation. That's not to say application is not a learned skill, though. ,I'd grab a few , and implement the ML algorithms you learned. Keep a public repo on github and apply with your portfolio.,Take this all with a grain of salt. This is what , would do. ,I applied SVMs in matlab in the course and my professor was actually the one that invented LSSVM. It wouldnt cost me much actually since I live in Belgium (I am American and plan to back home for work). My thesis is more solving a biological problem in R, not really data science. Maybe you are right though, I can start applying for work and see what happens. ,Fair. If cost isn't much of an issue then the decision does get tougher. May as well apply to both. ,You'll figure it out. You've gotta be a smart person to do what you're doing. ,Thanks! Even at this level I feel like I know nothing! I guess that's everyone though! ,I'm about a year out from finishing up a PhD in neuroscience and am looking to transition into a career in data science. I've been programming in Python for a few years now, mainly for my lab analysis (meaning I'm relatively experienced with the scientific Python stack). I've taken a few data science / ML MOOCs (currently working on the UWash ML specialization on Coursera). I've also been regularly attending a weekly civic hacknight for a few months now (and will continue to into the future), where I'm currently part of a group aiming to generate a predictive model to be employed by the city in which I live (we're working with the CDO for the city).,At this point, my primary question is what to focus on over the course of the next 9-12months to make myself more marketable. Due to the nature of ""data science"" being poorly defined, I find myself in the position of being somewhat overwhelmed about topics to study. Do I focus on the math / stats skills necessary for advanced ML topics? Front-end skills like JS / D3? Learning backend frameworks for Python? Learning database skills? Depending on where one ends up working these (among many others) are all skills one might be expected to have. What, though, would be the best thing(s) to focus on, and leave the others to learn over later?,TL;DR: Which undergraduate program seems better , or ,I am currently enrolled as a Data Science major at the  University of California - Irvine. Data Science is a brand new major, so I am concerned that I will not be getting as much out of it as I would in a regular Computer Science program. ,I chose the major because I am interested in Data Science. However, I am not entirely sure if it is the career path for me since I've been told that I would need to go to graduate school in order to be competitive candidate for a lot of jobs. I am also concerned that my programming skills won't be as developed as someone who is strictly Computer Science Major.,Click the name of each course to get it's description.,Thanks!,No advice but that Bachelors in Data Science looks awesome!,Data Scientist of 2 years here - of course, my experience may or may not be atypical of data scientists.,The data science curriculum looks great to me. I kind of wish that I had had a program with as much cool applied math combined with computer science classes. A comp sci major is nice, but I think it de-emphasizes the mathematical component and that seems like the part that is the most difficult to pick up on your own. I would suggest emphasizing math in undergrad and picking up the coding to support it. I'm biased though - I was a math major.,I would also like to emphasize that I only got a BA in math. I also got a BA in Economnics and a minor in Russian, and after that, I got a Master's in Nonprofit Leadership. It's perfectly normal to not be sure what you want to do, but as long as you do something math-y and something computer-y, I think you'll have the background to do pretty much whatever you want to do. Data science is a broad discipline that rewards breadth as well as depth.,TL;DR - Take some math, take some comp sci, and don't stress too much. ,Is Graph theory a essential course to learn?,no,What is the most practical way to transition into a data analyst role for a recent college graduate in a very non-technical analyst role at a Market Research firm? ,I ask this question as someone who has been researching the data science topic and trying to learn the ""basics"" over the past couple months but realized that some of the theory involved is far too complicated to be learned unless I was dedicated to learning it full-time. I'm trying to re calibrate my objectives and believe all I really need to do is land the most bottom-of-the-ladder jobs in data science and learn in that environment. For anyone who has been there or hires for these type of positions, what should I be focusing on learning and how can I prove I am capable in those areas? ,Thanks for any answers, I really do appreciate the availability of this forum. And please ask any questions if you need more clarification on what I mean. ,Been looking into some data science masters programs recently and am interested in pursuing a career as a data scientist. ,Currently I hold a UG in psychology and a graduate certificate in research analysis.. Additionally I have been working as a research analyst in government/public for roughly 5 years.. However I do not have any extensive programming or computer science background. I have been learning R to automate reports and have written numerous 3000+ line scripts in R, however I don't consider myself to be proficient yet. ,Would I be ready to tackle a data science masters program without a stronger computer science background, and is there any alternative programs that I could consider? Looking at the University of British Columbia program however it is $30,000 CAD tuition. Worth it in the long run for the increase in pay of course. ,I'm majoring in CS, but as a second major, would math or statistics be better? I was thinking stat BA then stats MA, but an adviser said math BA and stat BA might be better. Thoughts? ,In addition, my school is a large public university that only offers BA or MA. Should I go to another university for an MS for branding reasons, or does this not matter? ,Thank you!"

I'm looking to get more involved in extensive data analysis, but don't want to completely abandon being an actuary either.  What is your role and how did you get there?,Hey everyone. I've gotten into grad school (masters) for both Berkeley and Harvard. I'm asking for help on which school I should choose, and which area/school can provide the best resources for me to get better in the field etc. I'm having a tough time figuring out which to choose. ,EDIT: Here's my thinking...Berkeley is a top notch (#1?) school for CS, and is close to Silicon Valley, lots of jobs, internships, and opportunity there. Harvard isn't as good of a program but it's still really great by all means, and I might be able to make more connections with some smart people there. ,Honestly, those are great schools, and I doubt you'll go wrong with either. ,At this point you should be looking at professors you want to work with and try e-mailing them. Look at what the professors there are researching, and see how those compare with your interests (it's very hard to know before you do it, so make sure the school you pick has at least a couple people). ,I've heard Berkley being closer to Silicon Valley might be an edge in that they have some nice partnerships in some of their labs. Then again, Harvard is...Harvard...so...again it's really hard to go wrong with those two without knowing your specific interests.,Yeah exactly, the dilemma is both schools are great and I can't choose, lol. I did do mu undergrad at Berkeley, something to note. ,I'll research some professors, but overall Harvad's CS program is a lot smaller, especially in comparison to Berkeley's. There's also a rating disparity, with Berkeley being potentially #1, and Harvard not in the top 10 (though it's in the top 15). ,Besides that, I guess there's also the connections that could be made, with silicon valley as you said, versus most likely the vast amount of intelligent people at Harvard I could be talking to. ,Thanks, I'll be looking at the faculty tonight...as I need to make the decision tonight lol ,Yeah, I mean, the ranking might look good to someone who wasn't there. But people familiar with grad school mostly ignore the school's ranking.,What they'd care more about is who you worked with. What you worked on.,One benefit of a smaller program, you're competing with fewer people for attention from your advisor. Trust me, advisors are busy and finding a time to meet with them is going to be hard if they have 20+ students in a big lab. My advisor has one other student (he's a theory guy who wants to extend into more applied work, I started out doing theory and switched to more applied, now we work with someone else).,If you did your undergrad at Berkeley I'd go to Harvard. You are already in the Berkeley alumni network but you aren't in Harvard's.,No question. Harvard. Now the choice between Stanford, MIT, and Harvard would be interesting.,What were your GMAT scores?,Hey, interesting that'd you jump on Harvard. Any particular reasons why? UC Berkeley (with MIT and Stanford) is rated higher (#1ish), objectively, though Harvard has a plethora of other resources. ,For the GMAT, I got a 754 ,The calibre of the network you gain access to through Harvard. There's not even a question that you'll get an excellent education. ,I'd only suggest going a different route if there was a specific professor you wanted to work with at a different institution. ,Sounds good, thanks for your insight! ,That's strange, I'd have jumped Berkeley instantly. And Stanford first, no question there.,Those two are the better choices. There is a bubble mentality in Silicon Valley which makes them value those schools more than Harvard. You have to be there to understand it is present.,I haven't seen a question about this kind of Data Science job, so I'm curious to hear some opinions here on its viability.,I work at a fast-growing company where there isn't an established analytics team (though one will be developed sooner than later).  I'm currently working as an analyst, though I've moonlighted as DBA/report writer as well for the company over the past couple years.  I work across all parts of the company and have good relationships with managers/executives in other departments.,The job that floated to me by my manager as a 'next step' in my career is loosely labelled a 'Data Project Manager'.  The problem that this job solves is that clear and/or useful data requests aren't getting to me or the recently-hired DBA.  This means that data/report/analysis requests are half-baked and not fully thought through, resulting in me having to go back and redefine the requirements and requests before any useful work can happen. Unfortunately I can't do this as much as is needed because we are growing so quickly and my time is limited with fulfilling other (better-defined) requests.,Given that I have the ability to talk technical speak with the DBA, that I know the data questions/problems people have, and have good relationships with the executive staff, I've been asked to think about managing the flow of data requests from management.  This means defining what they need and then work directly with the DBA/Analysis staff to turn those requests into actionable reports and dashboards.  I'd be responsible for clarifying, prioritizing and then helping the technical team execute on requests from all over the company.,Is this sort of ""Data Project Manager"" role one that I should consider going into? It isn't a full-time Data Science/Analyst position due to its Project Management nature.  However, it seems like this kind of role might be necessary at companies - someone who can translate non-technical requests into clear requirements that DBAs/Report Writers/etc. can execute on.  Is this a specific role where you work?  Would love to hear other perspectives.,EDIT: Sentence structure cleanup.,This sounds much more like Business Intelligence than Data Science, but they are areas that overlap a lot so I think you would enjoy your new job.,What should I study as a (prospective) masters student?,Debating between Data Science, Statistics, and CS,EDIT: To clarify, I am considering applying for a few different programs--mainly NYU and Columbia as I am based in NYC.,I'd go with stats, unless you know that the people running the data science program are awesome. Data science being such a hot keyword atm mean that there's a risk that the content of any data science degree has been put together rather hastily. ,Statistics is fundamental to most of the analysis tools you'll use as a data scientist, and that knowledge will not be obsolete anytime soon.  The downside is that it may be slightly more difficult to sell yourself on the job market, so make sure to build/keep some programming and database cred on the side. ,Disclaimer: I am a statistician.,Probably really depends on the program. I know the grad stats program at my university still uses a lot of SAS in classes and things. Not sure about the researchers, but the students in stats classes I've taken (I'm CS) don't seem to know their way around other languages. You'll really want some Python and R experience. ,Honestly, if your CS program has someone who studies Machine Learning or Informatics or something of that nature (image processing/ computer vision/pattern recognition/data mining/social networks...etc) look into working with that person. It's really nice if they have collaborations with other departments and have data you can dig into. That should probably give you a pretty nice master's thesis and if you have visualizations you can show them in an interview. Try to work in stats-y type stuff if you can (you probably can).,I'd stay away from people who study ""AI"" as a lot of that tends to be search based algorithmic stuff, not so much data analysis work there.,I have no experience with a Data Science master's program. So, I have no idea.,If you do go into Stats, make sure to keep up strong programming skills. I interned on a DS team last summer and heard managers talking about not hiring several prospects they thought knew the stats but had no computer science background (I did get hired and start next Dec).,What resources area available for a manager of a data science team to become better equipped for understanding the technical capabilities of their team?,I'm not 100% ready to share the whole thing yet, but I am working on a series of posts on my personal blog about managing data scientists. Let me know if there are any specific topics you'd be interested in covering, I'd be happy to give attribution! This is one I wrote about structuring your teams: ,In putting links to my work on my resume which is better?,Github with basically raw code with few annotations.,Or ,Rpubs with RMarkdown documents that contain most of the code but also has some explanatory texts that go in to my rationale for doing certain things?,Neither of them.,Start a blog, host it on Github (as in huxleyan.github.io ), share your code and explain what it does in a concise way.,I got my first analytics internship (!) optimizing algorithms for the firm's software. I'll also refine some of their stats methodology. I'm crazy excited, but especially so since my role seems like it'll be a great opportunity to really explore a lot of ,. It helps (and hurts) that I'll be the only one in my role too.,My question is, , Of course, there's no one saying I can't do both, but I'm not very sure I understand the short- nor long-term ramifications of either. ,It's worth adding that this is a young firm. If I'm reading the room properly, I think gains in my position will provoke management to invest in an analytics team. This is highly speculative, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't on my mind.,Can anyone suggest a free data dashboard that I could learn/produce?,I'm on the more statistics side of data science, but I receive many data requests from colleagues on some simple computational things like means, averages, n's, etc.  They aren't hard to compute, but do take a little bit of time... and the frequency of these requests adds up the time devoted to producing these.  I figure I could just create an intuitive dashboard to help answer the majority of these requests.,Interactivity would be a plus.  Free (or really, really cheap is a plus).  Requirement of only basic programming skills a plus.,Make one in Shiny perhaps? ,Yeah I've looked at Shiny and I wanted to dive in it eventually. I just didn't know if it was overkill for the simple stuff I just wanted to report.,Do you use Shiny?,Yep, on occasion :) Most of work is for scientific papers though so the need doesn't arise that often.,Anyways, it's really quite simple to get started with; the tutorials are really great and hosting is pretty easy (you'll probably want to work with an IT person to get it hosted locally though).,The integration with various plotting libraries and their support for interactive tables should make it a good fit for what you want.,Qlikview. There's a free desktop edition, but it is rather limited. The enterprise solution is damn expensive.,I am doing a science PhD, have a lot (compared to others) of programming background and experience, have an R package on bioconductor which is used by a handful of people, other smaller things on github, and I am contributing to other packages with other people. My PhD started experimental but I am drifting more and more into the computational side of the field. Machine learning techniques are now gaining traction in the computational side of the field and I am learning and trying to find good applications I could dedicate a Postdoc to. Mostly I am learning by reading various internet sources.,I have different options which are not mutually exclusive., and should I put time/money into it, as opposed to learning by myself from ""diffuse sources"", or publishing (R package or paper) actually useful ML/DS work? I would guess less so on the academic side than to others once I want to get out of academia?,My interest is probably more on the side of ML as in integrating ML / algorithms in a tool / software doing a multistep workflow/task, as opposed to just analyzing data.,With the risk of being downvoted to hell I would suggest you less academia and more business. If you already have a working package on bioconductor I suppose you already know how to code in R, plus I suppose you already have a working knowledge of statistics and ML.  ,You are already at a better level than many, but if you want to work in the private sector you'll have to get your hands dirty with some job first. I mean that probably at the beginning you'll be more an analyst, but eventually you'll be able to go up the ladder. Unfortunately businesses don't trust anymore universities, even if you have a PhD (where I live a PhD could even be counter productive if you believe it) so they'll want to test you in the real world.,Currently finishing my phd in applied physics. I’ve been looking for data science jobs and am interviewing at a couple places atm, though still waiting to get an offer from anywhere. However, I currently have an offer for a data engineering position (from a large media company). I know it’s quite different from DS, but the fact is I’m running low on savings (my funding was cut a while ago so I finished writing my dissertation on my own dime) so would like a job fairly soon.,My question is, if I wanted to switch from data engineer to data science in the future, how easy/hard is it to make the switch? Should I wait for a data science job and not take the offer? ,Are Real Analysis and Measure Theory essential to learn?,For content, almost nothing; however I found Analysis the most helpful for understanding proofs.

I planning on probably enrolling in some sort of data science related masters program/certification in a year or so, or while I work if possible, but I'm just not sure whether or not this job will hinder/help me in the future. Thoughts?,You may have inadvertently revealed the name of the company by the position name (source: I work there). If it is indeed the same company, there is a thriving analytics practice at the firm and lots of practicing data scientists that you could network with. You will likely never work with them organically but you can leverage the firm's network to meet them and potentially get staffed on some analytics projects.

Start applying them on data sets that are of interest to you, or available in your current job/course of studies.,I hold a PhD in Physics and have been leaning towards moving in the direction of data science. I know of two people in my department who made the transition. One had a guy on the ""inside"" who secured him an interview or at least an in-depth look at his resume, and the other was admittedly very lucky in getting selected by a university recruiting pool for a large company.,I'm having less luck since I don't know anyone at a company in my area that is hiring and since I don't have industry experience in the field. I have completed several online courses (Andrew Ng's Machine learning course, The Johns Hopkins R and several Data Science modules, and a Kaggle competition), and I am pretty decent in R and some other languages.,I have been posting code to github as an example of analytical and problem-solving skill, but my hired colleague says that hiring managers probably won't look that deeply into my resume.,If that's true, and I don't yet have industry experience, what besides a data science bootcamp should I try to break in and get noticed? It seems odd to me that a PhD in Physics would not be regarded as pretty heavenly for this kind of field.,I have an astrophysics PhD and have recently made the transition. ,I ended up looking in a DS heavy area to relocate which opens up more options.  If you are just looking locally you may have less options. ,If you're stalling somewhere else in the pipeline I can give more specific advice ,Thanks for your detailed reply.,I do have analytical experience and tried to make that the focus of my resume but it may not be there. I received feedback from two people in the field and they both said it was really good, but they are also physicists by training so there is a likely bias towards my descriptions of my work.,Yes, I noticed in the Ng class that many of the methods were things I had done anyway but by another name, but as you said the jargon is very different. Bias-variance trade-off is important, but in physics we instead said to be careful about fitting your model to your data and that it's important to generate good hypotheses to test first. So if I hadn't had the course, I would have totally understood why one shouldn't just add every polynomial feature one could think of, but if asked to describe the bias-variance tradeoff I would have had to first think about what exactly they were asking. So it was very helpful there, and also for Neural Networks which I had never needed to use before.,I agree that the issue must be the resume (or not having networks in the field, since most of my physics colleagues went on to physics post-docs). Perhaps I can PM with you about this?,My physics colleague who was hired said that 7 out of his 8 interviews were through a referral, so I'm cognizant of the importance of networking. I'm still pulling strings on my network.,As far as the area, I'm in the Seattle area so I don't think the issue is that I'm looking only locally, though I am.,Feel free to PM,Seattle is a great area, so location isn't likely a problem!,First off: thank you for making this thread, this is exactly what some of us (me) needed. I'm currently a computer science student at a community college, and through the suggestion of a professor of mine who was once involved with the data department of a large company I have begun learning how to use Weka as a way to get started. I've got a few questions:,Just as a sidenote on the first question. I've used Weka/Rapidminer on the industry. But it's mainly used to test prototypes before implementing them on a programming language.,Some good answers so far. Here's some more thoughts:,I've never seen people use it in industry. It could possibly be used, but the two things that keep it from being super useful are inefficiency and difficulty of integration. It will choke on even moderately sized data and isn't something where you can easily make it part of some other pipeline, from what I recall. If it helps you get the hang of the basics though, then it could be valuable. 
When I'm hiring people, I treat Weka experience as something that doesn't add to their resume. It might help you answer some questions because of what you learned using it, but if the only experience was with Weka I'd probably pass.,Yep. I found stats to be insufferable until it got calculus based, but I'd be nervous hiring someone that hasn't at least seen probability and stats academically.,People don't often implement their own data structures to do data collection. More often they will get it from an API and put it in a database, then work from that. You can probably find some good blog posts about this stuff. I haven't really looked at these, but , and , have some examples. Some APIs lend themselves more to a SQL database and some are easier to get started with NoSQL.,Like the other answers say, R and python are pretty much king. I'd personally recommend focusing on Python as you learn. The critical packages to know are sklearn and pandas.,I'd probably just read blog posts and quora answers over books. It might be worth reading through the , to see what works in competitions, though there are some major differences between that and how data science is practiced. ,I think that this is a good idea--I had a Google recruiter reach out because he liked my blog posts, and I've only written a couple. You can start your own website (maybe a wordpress blog if you want something turnkey) and link to it from linkedin and twitter to associate it with you, and share links on places like here or twitter or datatau.,I'm considering jumping into a PhD oriented towards learning data science, is it possible to get into a program this year still?,No - application deadlines are usually in December.,There are a lot of places in Europe have running applications for PhD postions.
Go to , to see the positions currently available. There are probably some of them that will have a Data Science element. ,I'm finishing up my 3rd year of undergrad now. My degree is in Neuroscience, but I also will have a CS minor and quite a bit of math/stats by the time I graduate. I've also done fairly extensive research in bioinformatics and genomics (presented at conferences, should have 3-4 papers out). I'm interested in data science, so I've been thinking of applying for a PhD in bioinformatics/genomics and trying to get involved in a project that relies heavily on ML (this is becoming a big thing in genomics) and use that as a springboard to get into data science. Any thoughts on if this is a good way to approach this? ,I think it depends on what you want out of your data science career. ,If your goal is to just work in the general area of data science at some company, then I think its overkill to get a PhD (especially if your foundations are as solid as they appear to be). You would probably learn a lot more practical data science things by starting a job. ,However if your goal is to do data science in a highly-specialized area (genomics seems like one) or to be the head of a serious data science department, the PhD is a better route. ,In general, a PhD isn't necessary. I needed a Masters to get started on my track, but I know without question that the skills I'm learning over my three years post-Masters are more valuable than what I would have learned with 3-5 more years of academia. And I make more money, and I have more time with my family, and I arguably am a more productive member of society.,what types of things are you learning in masters that you wouldn't learn in undergraduate? I'm already double majoring in mathematics and statistics so i'm not sure what other skills are being taught in masters that i'd need (and could I learn it myself),I'm not sure what a Masters in stats covers, but it probably wouldn't be wise if your undergrad is stats.  You'd learn more advanced concepts which rarely come up in industry, but not advanced enough to be cutting edge, like what you'd get in a PhD. My first degree was liberal arts, with 0 math, so it was a no brainer for me to get an economics Masters.,I am a math undergrad graduating this summer.  I will be doing an internship this summer that involves predictive analytics and exposure to Hadoop.  I have been offered a full ride to terminal masters in economics program through a connection in my schools econ department(I was an econ minor).  I have been having second thoughts and have become interested in completing a masters in computer science with a focus in machine learning even though my coursework has only consisted of 3 courses in cs.  Am I making a mistake to turn down a free masters if my end goal is to work in predictive analytics?  I have been always been under the impression that I will need to complete a masters to secure a job in data science. ,Any advice would be appreciated.,Getting a master's is considered the standard for data science jobs nowadays. If the economics is an applied econ program with the option to study econometrics, statistics, and machine learning I would say go for it. I've met several econ students who went into data science. The computer science one is not bad either. It would help if you could link school curriculum.,You definitely can become a data scientist if there is enough quantitative coursework in your 2 economics programs. I doubt you will be able to a land a position right after the MS in Economics, unless you can get solid work experience will in school or take extra CS classes. ,You will be lacking applied machine learning coursework with real projects. You will probably have to start out as a economics analyst / research analyst and then work your way up to data scientist.,[deleted],I would go with option 2. The money will really come once you prove you're good at it. ,Hey, where did you do your masters from?,Good afternoon everyone, I have 10 years as an IT consultant and currently my manager has started putting me into more business oriented situations.  He utilizes me to go to meetings with other departments, look at the processes that some of our folks are scheming up and then we go back to our area and find the data that either confirms or denies what they are trying to do.  Most of this work has been in SQL, using Cognos, Power BI, and Excel as our front end.  Sometimes we'll pull data from outside public data sets if we need to.,This all being said, I'm looking at trying to get out of a worker bee IT job because I feel what I do is going to become a commodity in the next few years and into something that I think might be better for me and my family in the long run.  I love hunting for data, and trying to find correlations between things.  I'm 32, I've been in the National Guard for the last 15 years, and I finally finished a BS in Networking and Communications Management from DeVry last year.  I've been looking at Masters programs in Chicago in CS, Analytics and at MBA's to set myself up for my career move out of IT.,My feeling is that I could still do the nerdy things I love but catapult myself further into the business sphere with an Analytics Degree.  Am I crazy? Am I on the right path?  Any information would be helpful.,Thanks,
-Rob,Could you be more clear about your professional experience? Not sure what an IT consultant entails, and are you doing more data analysis work now?,You definitely are not crazy. If you enjoy number crunching, there are so many careers that have literally been invented in the last 20 years. I say if you like something, pursue it. Don't get stuck in a corporate job that just sucks your soul away.,I will be completing my business economics degree this summer and have enrolled in a graduate certificate program for SAS Data mining at UCF. I am curious what you all think about this path into the big data feild. ,There are no applicable big data technologies taught here. It is all data analysis and mining in SAS. ,Most big data engineers use the following technologies and languages: Hadoop, Spark, Docker, AWS, SQL or NoSQL databases, Java or a JVM language as well as Unix scripting.,Hi
I'm looking to become a data scientist, and I'm considering majoring in Statistics. I've been looking around a fair bit, and noticed that the main uni that I'm considering only offers a major in ""maths and stats"". Would this still be suitable even though I want to focus on Stats, or would there be better stats-centred courses out there?,Here is a link to the ""course breakdown"" (I've highlighted my selections):
,I've also come across a data science specific major at the same uni ...you can find the the course breakdown here: 
,Does this look like a good option, or would it be too ""superficial""?,It seems like a logical idea to major in data science if I want to become data scientist, but some people have advised me to stick to Stats. If I do indeed major in Stats, then how will I pick up all of the other skills needed to be a successful data scientist (business knowledge, computing theory, databases, etc)??,Thank you,Honestly, I'd go for the maths and stats degree. For the data science specific major, only about half of the core units are pertinent to the what a data scientist needs to know. Remember, the average data scientist spends 60-80% of their work-week extracting and cleaning data as well as exploratory data analysis. The rest is spent on meetings, visualizations and refining the algorithms.,Data Science - please for the love of christ, learn some design. ,Good - ,Bad - , ,Terrible - (because it passes bad design as good design and doesn't know a good data set from a meaningless data set). Absolutely horrible. ,If someone in your class praises ""Info-graphics"" treat their lecture and insights as if you were in an astronomy course and your professor started going on about ""astrology"". ,Seriously. Learn design otherwise you're just making things worse. ,So, i'm currently studying a double degree (commerce and science) and im majoring in economics, maths and statistics. And I'm also working part time as a data analyst (intern type role). ,Is a data analyst a good starting point to become a data scientist? I'm dealing heavily with Excel as well as becoming familiar with SQL and visualising data. ,Also, should I be looking into machine learning at all? My school isn't too good for computer science things (more IT). I'll be taking the intro Java course next semester which i hear is quite comprehensive and well run to get me started with some scripting and coding. ,If you want to be a data scientist, you , be able to program. Either R or python is fine - you should be good at one, and familiar with the other.  Very approximately R is better if you're focussing on data science; python is better if you want to program other tasks as well.,You'll also need some statistical modelling and machine learning tools in your toolbox. ,Right, awesome. I'm already at (i'd say) an beginner- intermediate level with R Studio. I can run for loops, double for loops, some basic randomisation/monte carlo your average statistical tests.,And with some higher level stats courses i'm sure i'll get better. what other type of Rstudio skills would i need?,I'd recommend learning the difference between R (the language) and RStudio (the IDE). For better or worse, people will tend to look down on you if you muddle them up.,Programming-wise, I'd recommend that you get familiar with the , and be familiar with ,. You should also make sure you're familiar with common packages for importing data, tidying it, manipulating it, modelling it, and visualisation it,Get comfortable writing functions in R, and learn how to use the ""apply"" family of base functions. Check out ,'s , Required reading for anybody looking to get serious with R, in my opinion.,Agree you need to be good with one. Disagree with needing to be familiar with other. ,Source: transitioning to DS with 0 R knowledge and have  multiple offers from great companies. ,Yes, you can definitely get lots of great offers without knowing any R or python. But you will be a much more effective team member if you have some familiarity with both.,[deleted],1) Practice doing data analyses on data that is of interest to you.,2) No. Most job postings list everything under the sun. Instead focus on picking up strong data analysis in (e.g.) R.,3) Yes,4) I doubt a MS in CompSci will help you with data science. I'm sure you'll learn about machine learning, but that's not going to help you much with day-to-day data challenges.,5) I think that's a reasonable timeline.,No need to focus on R, ,. If you're already a Python user, focus on the numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, pandas toolstack for data analysis. ,I don't know if this is appropriate for this thread, but I said I'd ask it here anyway. ,I've recently managed to get a job as a data scientist in a consultancy firm who mainly deals with large investment banks. My question is since that this is only a graduate position, I'm new to knowing what kind of day to day activities I should be expecting? ,I'm aware of what the role will be in general terms, but I was just wondering had anyone experience in this kind of position ,This varies widely from place to place. It's definitely something I ask during interviews (what fraction of your day is meetings versus code, etc).  ,You can expect working with data sources (identifying new data, cleaning and understanding new data), writing reports, documentation, following up with stakeholders, reading/research on methods.  The mix will depend on the sophistication of the tech stack, team needs, etc. ,That would've been a good question to ask. I had a strong enough understanding of what data scientists do, so I just never thought to ask what differences would pop up for working with investment banks and the like, rather than somewhere like Google or something. ,Thanks for your help,What are the day to day activities like?,Are there any math for data science bootcamps or good MOOCS? ,I would like to know enough math to understand many of the popular algorithms / methods - not just know how to implement them using existing libraries.,Most of the pure math needed is from linear algebra, vector calculus and some stochastic calculus when you start getting more advanced.,The rabbit hole goes really deep when you list out Statistics & Probability topics that you could learn. ,What do you think of the Galvanize Bootcamp? I'm trying to learn as much math, python, sql, and machine learning as I can before I apply.,Hi ,,,You asked this 1 month ago -> , and never replied to people there.,Perhaps reach out to those who have already responded to you?,Other links to look at:,Check out some reviews here: ,They also teach web development, so better CMD + F ""data science"",I finished my MS in mathematics last summer (August 2015) and found a job immediately out of graduation as a data analyst. Since job titles don't mean much, what I mostly do is ETL, data cleaning, EDA, and some very basic stats/machine learning. Most of my job consists of supporting other engineers and statisticians (not much ML on my team). I'm gaining some good experience and I've learned quite a bit at this job, but I feel like if I don't actively acquire new skills, I'll quickly stagnate. I'd say I'm pretty good at R and Python, data visualization, classical stats, and beginner-level machine learning (basically most stuff that's not deep learning). Where can I go from here? ,If you can do most machine learning aside from deep learning, you could be a proper data scientist at a Fortune 1000 company or tech startup or mature technology company.,You have a quantitative MS. You just need to re-position yourself and start talking to the right recruiters and HR reps.,I'm graduating with a double major in chemistry and sociology from a top tier STEM school soon, and realizing that I fucked up and have no immediate career options available to me. Oops.,Anyway, I am very comfortable with python (and familiar with a few other languages) and am currently teaching myself SQL and R. I took a few CS classes as a freshman and I've been doing chem research ever since. Is it worth even looking for data science jobs? I'm very in debt and have literally zero idea what I want to do long term but I'm getting desperate.,Have you tried applying for entry-level data analyst roles? Usually they hire recent college grads with good communication skills and some quantitative coursework.,I've tried a bit, but I'm not sure what they're looking for in particular (I'm workin retail to [not even] pay the bills atm). I'm also trying to get out of a location with a super dying economy.,I'm a third year Physics Ph.D. student specializing in computational biophysics. Over the last year, my work has become mostly writing analysis scripts in python, and I've come to realize I enjoy exploring the large data sets my group generates more than any other part of the work. ,To help me move toward data science, I've worked out a deal with the math department at my school by which I'll add 1 year to my Ph.D. program and graduate with both a Ph.D. in physics and a masters in statistics. ,As far as passion and purpose, I'd like to direct my skills towards the biggest problems in climate science.,I'd like general advice as to how I should direct my career at this point. I don't have a lot of free time given my research and teaching responsibilities, but are there a few key projects or online courses I should be looking at? Also, how can someone with my skills be useful in climate science?,Not sure if there are any online courses specifically geared towards climate science. This looks like a ,. Here is a PDF that gives an overview of ,.,You should start a side project that demonstrates your interest in climate science. Something such as...predicting extreme weather events like monsoons and droughts...automated discovery of ""insert key weather indicator""...or whatever topic your interested in.,Thank you for the suggested reading materials. I'll take a look at both. The PDF especially has given me several topics to follow up on. ,You're suggestion to start a side project seems like a simple but powerful step. Thanks.,Another way to get your feet wet would be to reach out to people who have published articles, papers or tutorials online about climate science.,For example, check out these publications on ,. Try reaching out to those authors. They might be able to point you to better resources. Show serious initiative and network with climate scientists. Many doors will open.,Have you thought about ""finishing schools"" like the data science bootcamps targeting PhDs?,I plan to apply to Insight Data Science and Data Incubator next summer. I've also been investigating the Data Science Dojo (1 week long) and two conferences in particular: Open Data Science and Strata + Hadoop World for networking and seeing the breadth of the field.,Beaker lab looks like a great resource for finding authors. Thank you.,Have you seen the reviews for Insight / Data Incubator throughout this subreddit? , and , ,Seems like a lot of people said the learning was a bit light, students were pushed to work for certain partner companies, and have a strong focus on accepting candidates which are '95%' of the way to being data scientists already.,Not trying to bash any competitors, but I work as a TA for the first online data science bootcamp. It's part-time, so you could complete it while doing your PhD. If this is something you might be interested in, I can send you some more information.,Sure, send me the info, and I'll check it out.,Hey all.  I am trying to make a career transition from a non-traditional background into data science.  The short version is that I'm trying to choose between two M.S. programs and could really use some feedback.,Here's the long version:,I put myself through college (B.A. and M.A.) in art history working as a programmer, database manager and an IT manager.  Since getting my M.A. I've worked in digital engagement for a major museum and now as the program director for some arts stuff at a college.,I've done some self-study courses through Coursera, etc. and then decided to apply to M.S. programs.  Got accepted to Indiana University and CUNY.  Since I'm not working in the industry right now I could really use some feedback on strengths/weaknesses of these options.  Here are my quick thoughts:,Pros: better university reputation; really strong researchers working in the field--they're working on creating a Ph.D. program too which seems to suggest a strong investment in the field rather than a fly-by-night cash cow program; good alumni network ,Cons: online program (which I would be doing) has many fewer class options than the in-person option, and perhaps for this reason the coursework seems broader and less of a step-by-step path to learning data science as a profession,Pros: more course options and more of a delineated step-by-step path to learning the material,Cons: school doesn't seem to have a great reputation at all, and the program is too new to have much data on it; the summer workshop course in which I'm participating seems very disorganized and poorly managed, which makes me worry that the rest of the courses would be similarly run.
pro/con?: seems to have more industry professionals rather than professors/researchers teaching,Other options: I could still apply to the , or the , instead.  Though with my non-traditional background I'm not banking on necessarily getting accepted anywhere I want to go.,Feedback from people in and around the industry--even other things I should consider--would be so helpful.  Thank you.,If I were in your position I would try to learn more and hone my skills via online resources rather than pursue a masters in data science if it wasnt from a good school (Berkeley/Stanford). Getting a masters still has opportunity cost and financial costs related to it so if it's not worth it, there's no reason in getting it,Are you trying to get a job after these programs? Find out what the placement data is for the MS degrees and find out how many professors have recently worked or are currently working in the industry. ,If there isn't solid placement data and the professors are just academic, look for something else. The tools and technologies are evolving fairly rapidly. A curriculum from 2 years ago would be fairly out-dated, and knowing universities, they like to re-use the same material and case studies.,Even Berkeley's coveted MS in Data Science does not have ""great"" ,.  If most got a pay raise, but not a promotion... does that mean most students were already data scientists?,I'm doing my minor in data science at an undergraduate level and my major is physics. I intend to pursue further studies or job in data science or statistics. Do I absolutely , to get a ms in data science for a better job? If yes, then what are the best universities I can try getting into? Or is it more beneficial to do another course which will be better for a job when coupled with a data science minor? Can I get a data science related job with a physics major and a data science minor alone?,MS in data science is not required but highly recommended if your background isn't in data science related fields or come from a well known school. Data science is a relatively new field but there are some good institutions coming out with data science programs including Berkeley & Stanford. ,I have a bachelors in math and physics but only took one course in probability theory and one in (calc-based) statistics. In other words, I don't really have a stats background. But, I'm interested in getting into data science. I've done a lot of scientific programming (think modeling work, lots of diff eqs, etc. not statistical modeling). What would be your advice on breaking into the field? I've thought of a few things:,What would be your advice for me?,Hi ,,,The short answer: it depends on what you want to do.  If you want to do ""Data Science Research"" then you will need a PhD. Otherwise, the three options you are looking at will all look equally well.,Honestly, my suggestion would be to go and find a data science job or group you want to work with and figure out the bare minimum you would need to go work with them.  This gives you a few things: a) a group of people to reach out to for advice, b) a very clear knowledge acquisition goal, and c) a clearer understanding of what is the best way to achieve that goal.,In regards to then achieving the goal, it'll be a balance of time, focus, and money.  PhD / MS degree takes much longer than a bootcamp though can be cheaper (or at least the cost is spread out over a longer time period).  Given bootcamp's geographical focus this can work much better for you than a general masters/PhD degree in a region of the world that you wouldn't even be looking for work in.,From your description, it sounds like you are trying to spread your bets so that if the data science thing doesn't work out then you can go do other options.  Anecdotally, this is the complete opposite of what you should be doing.  What you should be doing is placing all of your bets on one thing and becoming good at that.  Though outside of the data science sphere, Derek Sivers has a great post on how to get hired -> ,.,Good luck!,I'm currently not interested in doing research!,That is a great idea! I'll check if there's a meetup group around. I'll also look into different job postings that I would actually apply for.,Yeah geography and money are big issues I'm facing. I don't want to spend too much, so getting a degree might be better since I can most likely get funding, but they take a while to complete. I'm specifically looking into programs in Europe because the cost in the US is too high! I'm facing a similar issue in regards to bootcamps. They can be very expensive or cheap (specifically in San Francisco and NYC) two places I have no interest living in. I'd love to live in Europe for a few years.,But placing all my bets into one thing sounds like a horrible idea. I don't want to shoot myself in the foot. I want enough flexibility that I don't have to completely retrain if things don't work out, or if I end up really hating it. I have no issue with working hard at becoming good at one thing, but I'd rather do that once I actually have a job rather than doing that in my studies. I made that mistake during my undergrad and was very handicapped when applying for jobs.,You have definitely spent a good deal of time researching all your options. I strongly believe graduate school without 1-3 years of practical work experience is never a good idea, unless you plan on getting a PhD.,Where are you based right now and are you working full-time?,I am located in the US northeast and I have a full-time job.,If I apply for another job, it wouldn't be in the NE. I'd love to go abroad, but that hard to pull off without a graduate degree or relevant experience.,I don't have the background to get an entry level data analyst job at the moment so I'm kind of stuck in a hard place.,Hmm. What do you mean by this ""I don't have the background to get an entry level data analyst job""? ,These are the requirements for the first junior / entry-level data analyst job that I got from Google:,From the 5 minutes I've known you on the Internet, you clearly are driven and have great communication skills. You studied Math and Physics, you don't think you could pickup SQL or Excel?,I think I have everything but SQL and experience with data and statistical analysis. I wouldn't have a problem learning SQL I had to teach myself excel and VBA for the job I have now. It's the statistics part that worries me. I've even seen some data analyst boot camp done through various universities locally. I'd rather not invest unless I'm sure about it. I also prefer to work for experience and make money! But if you have a hook up at Google... :D,Sorry for the delayed response, but I work as a TA at the first online data science bootcamp. You may be interested as you would be able to attend live classes at night, while keeping your current job. Takes half of the economic burden off your shoulders. Want me to PM you more info?,Yes that sounds great, PM me!"

"Thread will stay alive until next one so keep posting after the date in the title.,Thanks to everyone for answering questions!,Type of Questions that fit here:,Link to Wiki that contains Questions & Answers from previous weeks:,Wondering about the success of getting a job in data science from taking online courses like Coursera or udacity.  I am a science teacher with a strong math background. Have always loved stats and the past few years have started some basic programming. I've got a dream but how do I get to a place where I am hirable? I don't want to waste time. Where can I developed useful skills quickly with little financial investment? Thank you. (Probably most interested in processing medical and genetic data but open to anything data related.),Both my BS and MS are in mathematics. I don't work as a data scientist, but I'm trying to get into that field. I think the Coursera course in particular is helpful to learn R, but not for landing a job. The Coursera lessons are basically videos where they give you R commands. And the capstone project is literally the same for everyone. You build an application to predict the next word in a statement given some text. So I would suggest Coursera just to learn R. Beyond that I'd suggest getting a certificate from a university to build credibility. Some programs are online and some universities allow you to roll a certificate into an MS if you find that you enjoy it. I'm currently trying to determine if I want to just get a certificate or want to go somewhere that has the MS option as well,Also I'd suggest building projects on your own and hosting them on GitHub to build a portfolio. It shows a couple things to potential employers: 1. interest in the field and 2. your coding skills...I would suggest updating GitHub consistently over time. Doesn't have to be everyday, but a few times a week sort of thing. ,Take a look at the S2DS (Science to Data Science) course offered by Pivigo. The online course is coming up (March) and on completion you can join the Pivigo hub & marketplace. Happy to answer questions if you have any. ,What do you actually , as a Data Scientist once you have a job as one?,So right now I'm studying CS, which I'm not really enjoying tbh so I'm considering of switching to the Data Science major at ,. The course outline looked pretty interesting and bit more appealing than what I'm doing right now, but so did CS before I started.  ,You can roughly (waves hands frantically) break down the data science process as follows:,Where steps 8 and 9 fall into:,a) Feature engineering – Variables to use
b). Metric selection – How is model evaluated
c). Algorithm selection – What algorithms to use
d). Parameter optimization – Tune model/algo
e). Deployment – Get it into production
f). Evaluation – Did it work? If so, how well?,For the most part, steps 8 and 9 are what you will find in Kaggle.  Which is why some people say that it's not a ""true"" data science experience.,Where in the process do you put learning new methods?,Learning is part of the job so it's part of every step.  For the most part each time you run through the above you'll learn new things based on either a) new data, b) new goals you want to achieve, c) new stakeholders, d) new tools, e) new blog posts you have read, f) new systems you have at work, g) new team members you are working with, h) new techniques developed in academia, i) new insights you developed from the last time you solved this type of problem, j) new insights you developed from working with a different type of problem, k) new time-based deadline (longer/shorter), l) new ways you have automated parts of the process, etc.... So it's hard to break it out into it's own specific step.  Some companies / organizations have lunch-and-learns, pay for books, pay for conferences, host meetups, suggest you go to meetups, get consultants/trainers to come in and teach, etc that are part of the job, but not a daily part of it.,Hi, I'm a college junior double majoring in Applied Mathematics and Economics with minors in Computer Science and Statistics. I have ~3 yrs of C++ experience, and I have recently been looking into learning Python for machine learning.,With that said, what would you guys recommend for an aspiring data scientist? Are there any githubs or programming languages that would be helpful to study to help me break into this industry?,In the classroom, I've tried to build a skillset that would be valuable in big data but admittedly I know very little how to apply this skillset in the workforce.,Any advice or feedback would be greatly appreciated!,Are you a junior undergrad? If so, you are well on your way. You have 2 relevant majors and 2 relevant minors (how do you have time for that) with good coding experience. Do you know R?,I'm currently in my 4th year of pursuing a BS in statistics. I just got interested in data science this year and I'm wondering if it would be worth delaying my graduation a whole extra year to get a minor in data science. 
Most people have been supportive of staying, however I was told it wasn't worth it because the field is so competitive. (Employers are only looking to hire masters and PhDs, a minor wouldn't mean anything). Just wanted to hear some more feedback, I can give more info if it'll help. Thanks!,I don't recommend it personally. Data science is new enough that most universities haven't completely figured out the most important / relevant things to teach (some places are good though like U of W or Berkeley, which maybe you attend!).,I would check out the response I gave in another , thread - ,most of it applies here as well :),I'm a PhD student in pure math looking to transition into data science.  How do I go about getting my first internship?,I have experience creating automated trading strategies.  I'm currently going through every online course I can get my hands on.,I'm hoping to have full time job next fall.  Is that unrealistic?,depends :),a) are you interested in working as a data scientist in finance?
b) do you want to work as a quant or a data scientist?
c) do you want to be a trader or modeler or risk person or something else?
d) are there finance firms in your current location?
e) have you asked your professors?
f) have you asked your professor(s)'s former students?
g) have you spoken to your university's alumni office?
h) is there one or many firms that you'd want to work in?
i) have you looked at career websites?  , for example.  As an approximation if a group is hiring full-time they are more likely than not to consider an intern because if it works for both, then they can hire them as a full-time somewhat shortly there after.,As for unrealistic - it depends on your knowledge, what knowledge employer wants you to have, and how hard you work at finding a job.,Two things: a) finding a job is now your full-time job and b) finding a data science job is a completely different thing than being a good/great/decent data scientist.  If you keep those two things in mind you'll get there faster than most people.,A phd in math is a great start.  I think this sub often stresses technical skills over business application though.  Data science roles really run the gambit from strong technical roles to the less technical more business-focused ones.  Regardless, a good internship or repo showing the ability to link theory back to business use will likely make you a really competitive hire. ,I'm also a PhD student in pure math and I got my internship last summer, now looking for a full time job when I graduate this summer. So I can say I was in the same boat as you. My advice:,People in math department are usually clueless about looking for jobs so don't bother talking to professors or postdocs for advice. Their connections could be helpful, however.,EDIT: format,Some of the things in my response here should apply to you as well - ,I would also check out Insight Data Science - , - which is a free bootcamp , for PhD's in quant fields to help them transition into industry!,Anyone know of companies that are willing to hire people with a recent PhD and no industry experience? I also have a lot of experience with Kaggle competitions and have experience working with large (terabytes) datasets. There seems to be a catch-22 in the data science world, where if you have not been hired before companies don't want to hire you even if you have the technical skills.,That's possibly true of all professions (need experience to get experience). It's not exactly revolutionary advice, but just keep doing what you're doing. With a PhD and Kaggle experience, you should definitely get something. You should possibly aim for entry level positions, if that's not already the case (foot in the door is better than foot in the cold). The main thing is to keep improving and not become frustrated. Good luck!,I have and would again hire recent PhDs with no industry experience. Depending on what those TBs of data sets are, they might not be relevant TBH - just to be aware.,Thanks for the reply. I worked with LHC data (particle physics), so the nature of the data set is likely different than industry. Still I assume that a lot of the skills are transferable, even though the techniques used and nature of the data is different. What company do you work for?,ex-LHCb here :),No, to be honest, it's completely different. Down to the concepts, even, grid computing is extremely different to how big data is done in the commercial world. I did the same thing too - I put big data on my CV applying for jobs. I now roll my eyes when I see big data on CVs of academics who havent ticked off any of the common big data tools like hadoop, spark or aws :) It's a common mistake, dont worry, but imho big data refers more to a tech stack than a skill set,Which country are you based in?,some of the things in my reply here should apply to you as well - ,I would also check out Insight Data Science - , - which is a free bootcamp specifically for PhD's in quant fields to help them transition into industry!,Hello all, I graduated in BS Business Administration, concentration in Finance and I'm currently a Data Analyst. I have 9 months of experience at my role and I would love to transition into a position of ""Data Scientist"" in the future. ,I need some advice on how I can make this dream come true, as in should I get a masters, do a data science bootcamp, languages that I need to learn etc. Thanks!,The easiest way is to transition in your current company if there is such a thing as a data science role. This is because you're already in the ""system"" if you will and can easily figure out all the key players you would need to interview with as well as what they want and currently due.  Plus you can be frank with your current manager(s) and the other group and figure out a plan to get you from where you are to where you want to go.,If there is no data science position in your current role, then the second best option is to look at competitor firms of your current employer.  Given they are in the same industry attacking the same types of problems, you are some what an ""insider"" as you already know the ""business aspects"" of what you are doing.,If there are no data science positions at competitors, then you are looking at the broader market.,The above is based on industry.  ML, Statistics, Programming, Math, Etc wise, you have to figure out what your current knowledge gaps are and fill them in through portfolio work or actual ""at work"" work.  The best way to do this is to figure out what data science job you would be 99% sure of taken if it were given to you tomorrow and deduce what skill sets you need to develop to properly do this type of job.,What's a better long term career move: getting into healthcare data or getting into financial services data?,pithy answer: the one you can stand long enough to build a career in.,longer answer: for finance - the regulatory environment is much more friendly in the UK to fin-tech developments than most of the rest of the world. for healthcare - the regulatory environment is much more friendly in the UK (recently the NHS partnered with Google) than most other places.,That said, if you look where investment dollars are going, it's in the healthcare space. Though because it's dealing with a very powerful lobby and very powerful government institutions, the pace is always going to be slow.,So it depends on: a) what you like, b) what you are willing to learn to the exclusion of other things, c) whether you are willing to move/live to an environment with friendly(er) regulatory environments, d) whether you are comfortable with the ethics/morals of the profession.,To the last bit - D - finance is generally seen as an evil necessity while  healthcare is seen as a noble profession.  So that could certainly play a part in it.,I'll just link my old thread here in hopes of more answers:,I recently made a career change and lucked out,  getting a Jr. Developer job for the BI team at a very large retail company (my degree is in liberal arts) .  I've discovered a love for the field and know that I'll be doing this for the rest of my life. I've furthermore lucked out in having one of the smartest guys I've ever met become my mentor.  He is the primary ""hadoop guy"" for our company and I trust his advice and judgment very much.  However,  I'd still like to see if you guys agree with the latest advice he has given me. ,Recently,  he and I were discussing my different career-path options. I told him that I've been thinking more and more about pursuing a career in ""big data engineering"" - my understanding of this career is that I would essentially be doing ""big data ETL"" - only instead of supporting report writers,  I'd be supporting data scientists.  He has advised me against this,  saying that he thinks that over the next decade most of these jobs will be replaced by libraries or tools that do all of this work for you,  and that if I wanted to work in the field I should pursue more of a data scientist position and focus on learning analytical concepts. Do you guys agree with this sentiment? ,I've found that,  although the analytical side of data science is most interesting to me,  what I really enjoy is writing code.  I've been studying functional programming lately (at the advice of this same mentor), and I definitely like this paradigm more than the object oriented code that I primarily write,  now.   However,  if this really is a career path that will shrink with time,  I think I should avoid it.  ,I understand that if I decide to go the analytical route I would have to go back to school (which I might wind up doing anyway) . I wouldn't dislike either route,  but I'm pretty sure I would prefer spending my days writing code over data-cleansing/gathering and talking ""strategy"". Do you guys think that this career track is viable,  or do you agree with him that my time would be best spent looking elsewhere? ,*Edited to fix typos.,Haha no offense, but data scientists won't be replaced by automated libraries and other software. Sorry, it will probably never happen. There are too many nuances to the job role and it's very tailored and specific to each company and organization within it.,I am sure your Hadoop guy is great at Hadoop, but data engineering will always be there, and so will data science. It's more about the appetite of your company, not the job itself.,Well, depends on your perspective.  The jobs will be there, but they'll change a lot and the skills and training required will drop as packages and tools become standardized. It used to take a PhD grad to figure out and implement a cost function, optimized algorithm etc. to do something like k-means clustering.  Now it can be done in one line of Python code.  Data scientists used to do things like manage the ETL process, write data-extraction scripts that would link up with front-end visualization tools that they would also write for the BI users.  Now a company can just buy Tableau or Periscope.  Everything just slowly moves towards a higher level of abstraction.  Data scientists are very useful when you want to move beyond the capabilities of those existing tools, or when you need to understand the nuances of how they work, or do something unique to your data, but the job is very different from what it was even 5-6 years ago.,What you just described is today's data engineer...yeah? Tableau is great for creating visualization, sure, but a) you need someone to be able to still create it and b) that's not data science at all.,I think it is a view on perspective, I'll agree with that, but I also believe data scientists are different within each company, organization, market vertical/industry,  among other things...being able to connect with the business side to figure what their problems are and then go to the technical side and take data to answer those questions -- whether it's predicting what the next best action is or some recommendation engine...whatever it may be. It all varies, but it's so nuanced it can't be automated.,Tableau is a cool dashboarding tool and all, but it doesn't answer data science questions at all. If anything, it's a great EDA tool to look at variables and correlations...though just as easy to do it in R or Python...elsewhere.,Yup it's definitely not data science (tableau) and you can do all of what it does with SQL, R, Python etc.  My point was that before, where you would have , a data scientist, or at least a strong analyst to pull out that information and make a visualization, now a relatively little-trained non-mathematical person can be taught to use Tableau without understanding any of the behind-the-scenes. Data scientists at the core are like you said, figuring out how to wrangle the data into a form that can be used as input to a recommendation system, a regression, a whatever to answer some specific query.  The , that enable us to do that become less rare as each step is made simpler through packages and we move up to a higher level of abstraction. ,Maybe I'm thinking about it the wrong way though.  If anything the advent of these types of tools seems to have , the demand for data scientists.,I could be thinking about it the wrong way, too. :) I'm just giving my perspective as a data scientist for a fortune 50. There are so many moving parts and while I think it's great that new software/libraries/tools are coming out to enhance my position, I don't think it can truly be automated. Some things, sure. :),Happy holidays, fellow data friend! :),No offense taken. So you think I would be safe to continue learning Scala / functional programming and focusing on the more programming-heavy aspects of data science? ,I've just searched a lot of data science ms threads and everyone seems to suggest that MS data science programs are ""gimmicks"". I don't get it? Do people seriously believe that (say) 4-5 graduate level CS courses and a few Stats courses together in one degree is a gimmick?,Keep in mind that these programs require as prerequisites classes in calculus, stats, linear algebra and data structures/algorithms. These programs are hardly introductory? Note that this is the norm of the ~6 programs I've looked at.,That doesn't seem to be a bad deal? Thoughts?,It depends on your perspective. I'd never pay for graduate school, because you don't have to. As someone who did a research MS in another field, and had it paid for through fellowship, I think the real value I got from my MS was my thesis, and not the classes. At a certain point, you can teach yourself anything someone would make a class on. IMO (and note, im not really experienced in this field at all, currently transitioning in) the best thing to do is tackle projects. I've personally never understood why people pay for both masters degrees and I'm flat out floored that people pay their own way in PhD programs. Neither of those things makes you competitive,The answer to this is easy, at least for me. Opportunity cost. I am in the Berkeley MIDS program. It will cost me $60k. If I went to a full time program and got it paid for, I wouldn't have to pay that $60k, but I would also be forced to forgo my current income for a year or two. As I already make six figures, the financial calculus , makes sense in a part time program. Berkeley is, as far as I can tell, the best part time program available. ,Edit: this is also true for many other working professionals, especially in fields tangential to data science like developer and data analyst positions, which are typically well compensated. ,Typically, when you get a fellowship/assistantship in graduate school, not only do they pay your schooling, they also give you a salary and benefits. I made ~35k a year and my rent was about 700 a month. I wasn't living in luxury, but I wasn't hungry.  This is pretty typical of all research based degrees. I am pretty skeptical of the value proposition of a ""classes"" only degree. But perhaps in CS/Data Science its different. I was in physics and earth science departments. ,I mean, one of the reasons I got the job I have is because I have a master's degree in the domain this organization operates in.  A master's degre isn't automatically a competitiveness maker, but if you've got a high level education in the domain subject matter, it can absolutely help.  In other words, if you're trying to get into data science for a business, a MS in CS is probably going to be less relevant than an MBA , the skillset necessary to do the job.,I think the top few are good (Berkeley, Stanford), but most are bad. There's a gold rush going on right now which is fine for universities but not good for students.,That being said...If you are going to do a MS program, I would test out as many classes as possible by doing a few months of part-time prep work. I work at a data science edtech startup and we've had a few people do just that. Self-learn the basics / first 1-2 semesters of curriculum and test out of them. Sometimes you have to be a little persistent, because some universities make it difficult for you to test out. It's , to remember that at the end of the day, you ARE the customer of the university and you have leverage to demand what you want. ,I would also spend a good 20-30% of your time building portfolio projects, going to data science Meetups in your city, etc. Many MS in DS programs don't have great career fairs / networks as they're still new and not established. I would recommend checking out more detailed advice from my reply here - ,I posted this in a different subreddit, received some good answers, but figured this might be a better spot for it. So here it goes...,Here's my story: I received my bachelors 3 years ago in finance and graduated debt free. I'm currently working in banking as a credit analyst, but it's not very intellectually stimulating. In school, I almost switched to cs or statistics as those two subjects interested me more, but I was already so close to graduating and there was no way I could switch. Now living in a little bit of regret, read a few Michael Lewis books, and interested in how to get into data science/analytics.,I would apply to a masters program, but i didnt have to take more than the basic stats and cs course in undergrad, so i dont really feel prepared to jump into that. I'm thinking of getting a postbacc to both boost my GPA and to get a better foundation before leaping in (either in stats, cs, or mathematical economics. I'm not sure which would prep me the most and I'm not sure if a full blown cs program is necessary or if I can just take a few courses that are most applicable). I'm also starting to take a couple MOOC courses in stats (to brush up), python, and data analytics.,So here's my question: Am I going down the right path or am I just kidding myself/wasting my time. I don't want to put myself in debt for a postbacc if I still can't get into a decent masters/PhD program.,Are there people out there that have taken this route? Either going back for a post bacc or from a nontraditional beginning?,Well I started off in chemistry/biomedical engineering and have slowly worked my way into a data analyst position and I'm currently interviewing for data science positions and it's going well.,I first taught myself MATLAB, Python, javascript, PHP, and MySQL, in that order, ad-hoc as I needed them to solve problems of interest, or for work, and simultaneously worked on building up my statistics knowledge.  Once I had a good grasp on fundamentals in Python and statistics I started learning the major packages such as Pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and NumPy that are used in data science, in addition to OOP principles, and other CS basics.  I then re-learned linear algebra and started reading up and understanding things like logistic regression, k-means clustering, SVD, etc. and started implementing them in my work.  I'm now about to start learning Hadoop and RDBMS in more detail, but so far not being an expert there isn't hindering my interviews, they seem okay that I'm willing to learn - there seems to be more demand for data science positions than there are people to fill them, at least where I live.,Going from zero programming knowledge in Python to now, has been about 3 years.  Didn't need a grad program.,I think a full-blown CS program will be unnecessary.  You don't want to be a software engineer or a developer, you want to be a data scientist.  While data scientists need to know how to program, it's not the same skill-set or depth of knowledge.  You don't really need to know how a compiler works or how to write your own OS, or probably even how to implement merge-sort.  The practical side of CS you can learn on your own.  Stats is another thing that I think is pretty easy to pick up on your own.  If you tell me the level of knowledge you are currently at I can recommend a few books.,I'm not the OP you replied too but I'll take you up on the offer of reading suggestions. I DID get a CS degree, a BS with minor in Business and some stats/higher math thrown in. ,With my programming background what's the best way for me to pivot into data science?  I'm willing to work at any level of the data pipeline and analysis process. ,Cool!  It depends on what area you're most interested in.  What are you working in now? With a solid CS background you're probably well-suited to developing, optimizing, and implementing learning algorithms, more-so than say the ETL process and database design.  But as a data scientist you'll have to straddle data engineering, as well as data analysis, do a lot of data munging, etc.  Personally I also do a lot of work on creating ""dashboards"" and visualizations for less tech-savvy users in the group to explore the data.  ,You'll also need to understand and interface well with the business side of things.  In my experience where most people seem to struggle when coming fresh from a technical or natural sciences background is on understanding the business questions and knowing where to look in the data to find the answers, then the ability to communicate those answers in a way that the non-tech teams understand and can act upon; the fact that you minored in business makes you more well placed for that than others might be.,What languages do you program in?  Coming from CS I'm assuming you worked mostly in C++ and Java?  It would be good to pick up Python if you don't know it already, and possibly Scala, but you'll have no trouble with that.  Some flavour of SQL will be essential.  If you want to do data science for a web-based company like say Shopify, or LinkedIn you'll need to pick up web tools like JS and PHP of course as well.,What is your level of statistics like?  Can you do various types of regression, tests for statistical significance, continuous and discrete and categorical variables?  Can you do more advanced things like clustering, classification, logistic regression, support vector machines and know when to use one or the other?  What types of learning and statistics you end up implementing will depend heavily on company and industry as well.  Right now I do a lot of clustering and PCA, logistic regression, and some simple neural networks and working to extract very noisy behavioural data.  Other colleagues are working a lot with SVMs, various ensemble methods and nice clean databases.,What is your current position (generally) and what is your level of stats?,I've only had some calculus and a couple lower level statistics courses. In school I worked primarily in C and C++. Since school I've dabbled in Ruby, rails, Python, PHP, JavaScript, go, and Java. I've also worked at every level involved with maintaining and spooling up LAMP and MEAN stacks as well as working with multiple flavors of SQL and NoSQL DBs. ,Experience wise I've been working in the medical sector. IT operations and recently moved to supporting medical facilities that use a particular web app.,Interpreting  business logic and workflows comes fairly easy to me at this point. I'd just like to make meaningful decisions backed up by data. Let me know of any books that would introduce me to the larger stats concepts as that sounds like what I'm lacking. ,Well I'd recommend:,For a more basic stats refresh before you dive in, pretty much any introductory textbook will be sufficient.  For a very basic but quick and dirty refresh on basic stats you can get: ,Thanks that looks exactly like what I need. I am refreshing basic Stats stuff right now but wasn't sure on next steps. I mean I've been through discrete math and the CS side of algorithms but I'm not sure how to do much with data sets beyond mean, avg, etc. ,Good luck!,You and I seem to be taking very similar routes, but you're about 2.5 years ahead of me.  I'm coming from the social sciences (with a fair amount of hard science included), and about 6 months ago landed a job in data, though I can't determine if the position falls more into analyst or scientist.,Looking back, do you think it would be more beneficial to develop the programming skills or the math skills first?,I applied to masters/PHD programs in economics and finance but am not totally sure about grad school. I'm in a researchy role where I work with data. Can I get data science roles with just a bachelors? Should I take the second of a graduate mathematical statistics course or focus on learning to code better in R/Python?,Question: Is there demand for engineering focused data scientists? By 'engineering focused' I mean building production machine learning models (e.g., recommender systems, risk applications, etc) vs report based insights focused data scientists. To be honest, I'm not even sure this is a proper distinction.,Background: I'm currently a 'Data Engineer' with a graduate degree in finance (heavy quant stuff mostly). My main every day tools are Scala, Spark, Hive, and other Hadoop related projects. I deal with 'big data', essentially handling ETL and infrastructure surrounding 100+ terabyte data sets as well as streaming ingestion. ,I consider myself an engineer at heart as opposed to a scientist, but I love learning more about machine learning and deep learning. As I mentioned, I have some quant background, but nothing in ML/DL other than some MOOCs and the like. ,I have worked closely with data scientists at a previous job, and I find that a large amount of them don't really put production systems together. Most of the code being in notebooks, not optimized/tested/built for distributed systems. I know there are unicorn engineer + data scientists but I'm hoping there are positions for engineers with some quant chops.,Thanks!,Yes, these are definitely attractive strengths.,We're looking for Data Engineers with these qualities to help us develop and apply machine learning models at CrowdStrike (crowdstrike.com),You can check out one of our openings here: ,I have a PhD in Math and actively do research in Graph Theory, but it's all theoretical research. I'd like to learn Dat Science techniques to (a) contribute to applied projects for social good, and (b) eventually supplement my income by contracting. I don't want to become a full-time data scientist. I have experience with Python and MatLab but have no background in anything data related, nor do I have a strong stats background.  Where would be a good place to start? Coursera? Some good books?,if you are like me, and love going through text books and coding things up, I really like this free book ,.
I've  been going through it, and have purchased the more advanced version, elements of statistical learning too. I like them both in tandem because intro does a bit more hand holding where as elements is just like a dictionary of ML algos ,Thanks very much! I'll look through it.,My goal is a little different from a traditional data science position.,What I would like to do, eventually, is work on organizationally implementing high level data science work in business operations. From my view at Big Corp, the major gap and room for improvement is to make the work done by our data science team more accessible and practical to non-technical leaders in our sales and ops teams (which is to say, most of the company).,My company has a data science team that does good work, but they are generally on an island, and have a difficult time ""evangelizing"" their work to the aforementioned sales/ops groups. So what I would like to do is get into a leadership position of some sort in order to better bridge that gap.,I'm currently working as an analyst for one of the Ops departments, reporting directly to the department's senior leadership. My role is a good amount of BI, but allows room for me to develop more analytical projects. I'm also working on a part time masters in data analytics.,My question is, what is the best way to pursue this type of DS leadership? Should I get a MBA? Should I try to manage a team of analysts? Should I try to get some experience as a ""real"" data scientist first? I realize there is no right answer, and it's highly subjective, but I'd appreciate any perspectives.,Hi all- I've been working for advertising agencies for the past 8 years (Copywriting, client service, digital campaign management) and hold an MBA in Gen. Business Admin & a BA in Communication. I'm coming to terms with the fact that I'm an introvert and don't feel like I am really thriving in my line of work. ,I'm interested in how big data is transforming the business world. I'm also very interested in the overseas career prospects (ie in western Europe) associated with this line of work. I would really like to speak with a career expert about my situation and get their advice. Would anyone be able to recommend a consultant or company that can help? ,By the way, I have basic programming experience in HTML/CSS/Visual C++ from 10 years ago.,Thanks in advance!,I'm late 30s with a Masters in Engineering from a top 50 school. I have a lot of different work experiences including business and technical and am versatile. (Hesitate to put work experience since the variety is probably self-identifying if someone wanted to work hard enough. Presumptuous, I know.) I have no depth to speak of but I want to settle down and achieve consistent income even while I have an entrepreneurial personality.,From my brief exposure to each, I like them both.,The upside of pursuing/certifying in analytics would be shorter training time and more work available. (Maybe) The upside to data science is a more tangible, ""hard"" skillset that can get a longer term job and not be project to project. By this I mean a PHD or similar from a university.,For all intents and purposes I'm unemployed currently. So I'm looking for something that I can start making money sooner than later without majorly jeopardizing long-term prospects. Also, looking to do something that will have long-term consistency.,Thanks!,So have just graduated with an undergraduate degree in data science (my school had the first one), and have been trying to get a job in industry for a few weeks now. I haven't heard back from anyone yet, hopefully soon. My worry is that even though I have a solid understanding of machine learning techniques, statistical models, programming in python, some java, a little R, and a good understanding of database concepts (SQL, noSQL, scaling), I have very little experience other than my course work. Most job descriptions want years of experience and proven track records. I'm an extremely quick learner and feel confident that I can obtain any needed skills quickly, but it seems nobody wants a budding data scientist with a bachelor's, they want Phd/Master's educated folks with at least 2-3 years experience. How do I market myself/get my foot in the door?,I'm a recent grad in Economics, I decided to set my sights on Business Intelligence and Data Science after getting started at a tech boot camp to learn programming. Being completely new and having interest in all of the nearish fields I'm a little confused on the commonground/differences.,What are the key separations between Data Scientist, Business Intelligence and Analysts? I'm seeing a lot of common ground and I'm starting to try and develop a focus.,When people are looking through a portfolio what sort of skills are they looking to see you have in a project?,How important is learning Bayesian Statistics/Machine Learning?,Any experience or knowledge on the Udacity Nanodegree program?,I just discovered this subreddit and I really love the community and helpfulness I've seen so far. Thanks in advance for everything!,I think the traditional data scientist role is the application of machine learning algorithms to gain insights into data that perhaps earlier data analysts could not do. Bayesian stats and Machine learning are not the same thing however. Bayesian stats are very popular right now because of people like Nate Silver who are big believers in the bayesian philosophy, but 10-15 years ago this was not the case.  Machine learning, at this point, is pretty easy to employ. SK learn and tensor flow make mathematical understanding of the numerical processes underlying the algorithms not as important. These packages are like squarespace but for machine learning. A bit more complex, but nothing like writing out the maths by hand. Currently I am in a DS bootcamp, and am surprised at how easy these methods are to deploy. That doesn't mean DS is easy, but my guess is that entry level positions involve a lot more data munging than ML. Sorry this is a bit stream of consciousness. Anyway, to answer your question, Stats/ML are very important, but they are not as hard to employ as people might think. ,The Bayesian philosophy has always been there, it's just that 15 years ago we didn't have the processing power to roll with that philosophy. Now we can.,If you haven't explored Bayesian networks, I highly recommend it.,It's a bit of a shameless plug, but ,. The most simple distinction is that data scientists programme (python and R, particularly). ,Just a real quick question and not to throw anyone's experience and hard work out the window but I am wondering something. I work in the military as a network admin and I'm Looking into this field for when I get out. I keep seeing ads on face book from springboard offering a 12 week data scientist program. How credible is that? At first I was like ""that's it"" but after reading this ole Reddit has got me thinking otherwise. Please shed some experience with this type of certification from this avenue. Thank you! ,No info? ,Hi all,My partner is a commerce graduate who has worked in category insights in a large fast moving consumer goods company that owns a number of popular grocery brands.  A lot of her work involves going to the supermarkets with customer insights for different categories based on shopping data provided by third party research companies (and even by the supermarkets themselves from their in-house customer loyalty programs).,My partner is investigating options to move into these third party research companies which often require a lot more analytical type skills in manipulating the data for end users (such as the FMCG company she works for).  She has excellent skills at creating a ""story"" from data and understanding the ""why"" (which is very rare among peers) but would need to improve her understanding of the more technical skills such as extracting data basic SQL and using quantitative statistical methods with programs like R or SPSS.  At this stage the industry is moving very slowly to incorporate these skills but she wants to get ahead of the curve by doing some self study. ,Does this seem like a good idea? She doesn't want to become a database administrator but instead have the skills to complement her presentation and storytelling ability with basic analytical skills that are becoming increasingly important.  It would be good if anyone has experience in customer insights in similar industries and whether these skills are becoming important.  We live in Australia so I wouldn't be surprised if we are somewhat ""behind the times"" in customer analytics in grocery channels. ,Additionally, can you recommend any courses or books for her to research so she can obtain these skills? We were planning to go through the courses for SQL in codecademy as a starting point. ,Cheers!,Analytics skills are always in demand. I am from Australia working as a Data Analyst in utilities. Have ex-Coles employee working next to me. It seems that many FMCG companies have either hired or actively hiring data scientists. Your partner has an advantage of the domain knowledge, which is good, but with no background in CS or statistics, she will struggle to compete. By all means, learn SQL and R but be realistic. Even data analysts are supposed to have  solid programming experience of several years with SQL and usually at least Tableau plus very good Excel (macros). Commercial analysis can be hired with Excel skills only, but they are not expected to write SQL queries.,Hello! I'm a graduate student in Health Policy (Masters) in the US which entails training in the financing and organization of healthcare as well as a good amount of biostatistics. In addition to this training, I also have a significant amount of work experience in a sort of introductory data science role working for a think tank in San Francisco.,I'm currently exploring career paths, but I'm having a difficult time finding careers that mesh well with my skillset because most people I talk to only know one field but not the intersection. Do you guys have any suggestions for where I should be looking? I do recognize that think tanks would be one avenue, but that is not an option because I do not have a PHD. I think that a role which straddles the policy world, as well as, the data world would be a place I excel. Apologies for the vagueness. I feel as though I'm still stumbling around in the dark with this.,I'm a 1st year PhD student in clinical neuroscience, with a Msc in cognitive neuroscience, specialised in research. When I started my PhD, I started tesching myself python and started programming all sorts of tasks, experiments and useful scripts. In the past few months I figured out that it is exactly these tasks I am looking out for in my work, as I am bored of other tasks I have to do (FMRI measurements, writing papers etc). I have never considered myself to be an analytically gifted person, as I always assumed my level of understanding is just average in academia, although I always had good grades in stats class... Right now, I am unsure if I should continue my PhD as it seems a bit of a waste of time. I spend so much time on tasks I consider useless for my later work life . At the same time, I do believe that a PhD will always be an advantage later on. My current thoughts are to continue the PhD and focus more on python and ML and try to publish work that involves both. After my PhD I would like to apply for a data science class boot camp (e.g. the SAS boot camp in the netherlands) to even specialise more. Do you think someone with my career path would be attractive for companies to hire, even though I never majored maths/stats/cs? Or would you rather try to get a masters in datascience over a PhD in clinical neuroscience?  ,I'm a recent BS Math graduate looking for an entry level data analytics role. ,I have a few projects, high placements in Kaggle competitions, half a dozen or so languages under my belt, but graduated from a mediocre institution with no internship experience. I've interviewed for a few roles in the past 2-3 months, but looking forward I'm trying to prepare some fall back options if the stereotypical ""data analyst"" role doesn't materialize.,What are some other roles that are worth looking at as short term options (6 months-2 years?) that would perhaps be easier to attain but still somewhat relevant to a future data analyst/scientist position?,Thank you to everyone who is contributing here. I graduated in 2014 with a B.S. in psychology from a decent University of Wisconsin university. Data science/mining/analytics has always been something I wanted to pursue but when I was in school there were no degree programs in that field. They have since received a very large endowment/gift/grant from a very large insurance company headquartered in the same city as the university. I incurred more debt completing my education than I'd like to admit and I do not have the income needed to pay for classes out of pocket. My question is, knowing that the demand for data scientists outstrips the supply, has anyone come across companies or organizations that are willing to train or cover the cost of education for individuals with a strong interest and aptitude for such positions? I'm trying to get the training/education on the cheap so if anyone can point me in the right direction or offer a boot camp recommendation I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks everyone!,Hi, I am soon graduating in Economics and Philosophy (BS) and I really loved the Statistics courses in my Economics degree. I plan to find a very basic internship at some market research company over the summer and plan to go for another BS in Stats in October.  ,The curriculum consists of:,
Math: Analysis 1-2, Linear Algebra 1,
Stats: Descriptive, Inductive, Probability and Inference theory, Linear Models, Advanced Regression and Multivariate Stats,
Applied Stats: Sampling theory, Experimental design, Time series analysis,
+ what I think is the best thing about it: lots of applied work with currently demanded software such as R, SAS and SPSS.  ,I can take a minor in CS, Business Administration or Biology. I currently debate between CS and BA.,Is my plan solid? What should I be most focused on during my studies? What skills should I develop next to my studies to have an easier time landing good internships and eventually a job later on?,
- academic background: BSc in Operations Research (linear algebra / calculus / stats all brushed up), currently on a study track in ML on Coursera (few personal 'baby' projects completed + investigating opportunities to apply at work),
- can code in Python & R and acquire data with SQL - nothing fancy, but definitely familiar with the environments (using more often now at work for simple ad-hoc analysis),
- worked for 2 years as Analyst in a non-tech company. I am the one and only person for all data inquiries (hooray, this is the beginning of data science, right?); most of these are basic, but I developed a good practice of following a ds approach to any data problem, big or small.,
 
,
Become an expert data scientist, solve challenging problems and lead high-impact projects, fully utilizing my analytical abilities. The question is, how do I optimize learning to get there?,
  The course of action needs to be chosen at this point, and I am checking my 'math' with you guys and girls (I also reached out to local DS community through the meetup):,
- learning (and growth) at my current position is very limited; possibility of developing myself as a capable data scientist without a move is extremely low. Thus, move is required.,
- My skill level is not sufficient to make a 'jump' to a data scientist role, but, with some work (scope to be determined), I can score a data analyst position within an established data science team and grow from there.,
 
,
Does that sound like a good short-to-med-term goal?,
 ,
Thank you for your input!,Hey, I got my bachelors degree in Applied Physics last spring.,During my undergrad, I discovered an interest in programming/CS, which has now lead me to data science, seems like a perfect fit for my interests.,I have expereince with C++/Java/LabView, as well as some knowledge of cs concepts like data structures and algorithms.,I am now trying to decide between taking the Coursera Data Science Specialization by JHU, link -> ,Or going through the ""Open Source Data Science Masters""
link -> ,Perhaps the coursera course first then the Masters?  The open source data science masters has TONS of courses/information.  Which is kind of hard to wrap my head around...,Ultimately it seems like whichever one gets me working on projects/real applications first would be better... As that seems like the best way to learn, and raises employement potential...,Just curious to what your opinions are on the two courses, and learning DS in general...,Thanks a bunch! :),I currently live in Pennsylvania, and I'm looking into different online Data Science Master's degrees. One university that stood out to me was UC Berkeley, but I hear some people in my local group saying that getting a degree at Berkeley won't help in my career in PA, while others says it will because it's a great university. Should I pursue in a degree from Berkeley? Or should I get a degree locally?, ,You may not like this advice but I recommend first optimizing your regular daily workflow first and then think about the data science career transition second. The 2 best books, both short reads and very insightful, for these are So Good They Can't Ignore You and Deep Work, both by Cal Newport. Before shelling out $, you can get a sense of the frameworks he presents by reading his blog - calnewport.com/blog,I'm not a big fan of career advice books in general, and ironically neither is Cal. He's a Computer Science professor who wanted a more evidence based, ""boring"" framework for thinking about careers and work routines (over feel good wishy washy ideas). If you're still stuck after reading his books, understanding his framework, and trying to implement some of his ideas in your own life, feel free to DM me directly.,Actually...awesome advice. I'll look into those books and circle back if I have questions. Thanks!,As an economics undergrad with minor in statistics who wants to enter the field after getting a masters, what internships should I look for in college to show interest in the field? 
In other words,  what internships can I get with my background? 
I've been learning r and will take up python around mid-2017. ,Is there an updated dataset (from LinkedIn or Indeed) that shows the most required skills/traits to be a data scientist?,Hello, I am a PhD student, looking forward to a career as a data scientist in the near future. I have done a couple of projects, and I have begun to write them up as blogs before I start applying for jobs. This is my first project: A web app to predict airline delay, and compare airline performances between two airports
Blog: , App: ,
I spent quite some time understanding the process to set up a Heroku site to serve scikit-learn models, and I put down my learnings as a tutorial (in case it is helpful to anyone else): ,
Any comments/suggestions on these would be much appreciated. Please note I would be showing these to potential employers, so any comments/tips in that regard will be helpful. Thanks!,Hi, I'm a psychology student that just finished my Honours year in Melbourne. Throughout the course I realized that my favorite part of the entire experience was inductive statistics, and I'm thinking about doing a Master of Data Science. However, I'm unsure about a couple of things. Firstly, I've heard online that Data Science degrees typically aren't even very good because the field is relatively new and universities aren't sure what to teach. Secondly, I've got a very firm grasp of the basics of statistics (I definitely don't just ensure p <.05 and leave it at that), but I'm very aware that this only makes me a big fish insofar as many scientists are clueless as to how statistics work. I also don't have any experience with coding, although I learn quickly. I'm very passionate about this idea, and I've just finished a year of research (my Honours year) so I'm not 100% green, though I'm still pretty green.,Does anyone have any pointers or would anyone be willing to talk over PMs? Particularly someone that is currently employed as a data scientist or is an employer.,Thanks for your time!
Nik,There are some good Data Science Masters in Melbourne, for instance, UniMelb program is great. Unfortunately, you lack fundamentals (did you study linear algebra?) thus any DS program that would accept you is probably not good at all. ,If you are seriously interested in data science, you need to re-train, i.e. do a second Bachelor in statistics or computer science. Alternatively, get into a Graduate diploma of Mathematics and Statistics at UniMelb and take 2nd / 3rd year statistics subjects. That will allow to progress to the Master of Data Science later.,I would like to ask how all work related to data science is actually divided between different employees. I am talking now about at least mid-sized companies, who need to process a lot of data.,Are there purely data science analysists who have pretty good math and statistical background and who make decisions about what algorithms and what portions of data to use to get the desired outcome. And to support these guys there are also more technical guys who actually implement solutiona designed by data science designers.,I just feel that in order to be good in data science you need to be good mathematician - at least have some degree in that field either undergraduate or master's degree. Otherwise you will be just messing around without knowing what you are actually doing and without performing too well. Therefore, just to have software engineering skills is not enough. Even just to pass one-two courses about statistics/maths/machine learning will also not give you sufficient knowledge to solve real-world tasks efficiently. The subject is just too broad and extensive.,At the same time, basic skills of mathlab/R/python which most mathematicians definitely do possess would not be either adequate to be able to develop high-quality software...,I realize, that the answer to this question highly depends on company size, project budget and amounts of data needed to be processed, but still... I feel like small companies would not bother themselves with all that stuff, they will just have some analyst who does everything manually or writes small python scripts at the most without much automation.,Is there a dataset from LinkedIn or Indeed etc?,Classification of scientific journals
,Hi guys, I am third world country (Pakistan) resident and plan to spend the rest of my life here and make improvements where I can however small it may be. I am a Business Mater's with a job in the banking sector and I work with managing data and making some simple progress tracking reports. The banking in this part of the world is still backwards in terms of understanding the data. Mostly have to resort to making manual reports using excel.,Not much can be made of the city wise data, I have access to daily data being generated by the bank but still most of it goes to waste. ,I have always had an interest in data and computing to work out something like the famed diapers and beer correlation but sadly couldn't study further into it. Now as I am a self sustaining individual I want to get into the field of data science, here in my country I we don't really have much going on with regards to Data Science. What are my options here? How should I introduce myself into the basics of it? There aren't any jobs here for data science here but I want things to get going here.,Currently working in data analytics and the majority of this job is business.  It feels like I have to have a thorough understanding of the business, and to an extent that makes sense.,I'm looking for something more technical rather than qualitative. Do any of you work in jobs which emphasize technical skills over business, or am I in a typical role?,Ok so I'm starting basically from scratch and was hoping for some recommendations. I am 30 with ~8 years of Finance back office/accounting experience. I've passed level 1 of the CFA and am working on level 2. The CFA does have a stats portion to it (like right now it's about multiple regression and time series analysis). Anyway I'd like to make a transition to something quasi Finance and data related to get some experience to then use to get a Masters in Data Science. What courses (like R from coursera), programs, or jobs I should be doing/looking for? Any advice or feedback would be greatly appreciated!!,Strongly recommend avoiding Data Science degrees. If your company has a data science or stats role, reach out to those people and find out what it takes to make the transition,Thank you!,Learn R or Python first.  The edx course Analytics Edge would be good start if you want to learn R and practice analytics.  If you want to take a course on Python/computer science fundamentals, MIT's 6.0.0.1x is a good class.  Udacity's Data Analyst nanodegree is a good option once you learn Python, or Harvard's cs109 data science course.  ,Hey guys, I graduated with computer science masters degree last fall. I got a job as an iOS developer. I am more of Web/mobile application developer. I have been looking into transitioning to data science for quiet a while now. But haven't been able to get to a start point. I was thinking to start with the CS109 course by Harvard. Is that a good move? If not, Where should I start? Where to go from there? I have intermediate knowledge of python if that helps. Any input would be appreciated. ,CS109 would be a great course for you, go for it.   Watch the 2015 lectures and labs and do the 2013 homework.,I’m a former astronomer looking for a job in data science.  Was scouting around the interwebs for possible conferences or job fairs to attend.  Does anyone have any experience with the American Statistical Association’s “Conference on Statistical Practice”?:,I guess the registration deadline is in 5 days, so I need to decide if I’m going or not.  They have a job fair there, but I’m wondering if anyone with experience at these things knows if the jobs at a conference like this tend to be suitable “entry” jobs for someone new to the field?  For that matter, can anyone familiar with the ASA comment on where it fits within the constellation of data science organizations?  Is this more for people who are academics within math/stats itself?,I have a potentially huge opportunity: I am a data analyst for a large company that manages all its data via Oracle tables and Access sql. I've been asked for thoughts on streamlining and modernizing the process. What would you recommend?,has anyone transitioned into data science from business intelligence? can anyone comment on how realistic or effective this would be? the workflow and skillset of both jobs seems roughly equivalent.,Hi, I am a BS Math-CS Major at UCSD. I am thinking of minoring in Cognitive Science and take Data Science specific classes revolving around stats and machine learning. Is there such a thing as an internship for aspiring data scientists like there is for software engineers. Thanks for any responses. Also, is it possible to land a data  science/engineer job with a BS degree or an MS degree is required? ,I just landed my first job in December. I was an industrial engineering major at a top university with a certificate in CS. I have a strong stats background, lots of statistical and mathematical modeling experience, a couple courses in machine learning/AI, and a breadth of programming/project experience; I got hired as a Data Analyst at $50k per year.,.....let me tell you: it's really, REALLY competitive out there for data science roles. I spent at least 3 months learning that the hard way before I could swallow my pride and scale back my expectations. The demand for data science is shockingly high, but there aren't enough people with the experience, expertise, and entrepreneurial spirit that companies look for in data scientists, and absolutely , is recruiting undergrads for Data Scientist roles (even if you're a double major, which is really impressive). Not trying to shoot you down; I'm just sharing the harsh reality of entering the field as a new grad. You might spend 30 hours building a predictive model for an interview assignment, but you don't get through to the next round. You would have to be a truly stand-out individual with raw talent and a rich personality to snag a data science role over someone with prior experience, even if you have a more fitting background.,Now, with that said, it's not all doom and gloom; let me share the brighter side:,I honestly wouldn't trade my role now for any single data science position that I had applied to before. Where I'm at now, I get to work on an amazing development platform, I have full access to a very large and very intriguing database, and I'm building a machine learning model that will help automate an expensive process that they currently perform manually. ""Data science"" is not in the title; it's in the environment you'll be a part of.,Sorry for the rant; got a little carried away here, but it was a good chance to pass along some wisdom and do a little reflection, myself. Here's what you can do to give yourself the best shot:,If you have any more questions, I'll skip the ranting and help however I can.,Definitely not true. Most people who are qualified for the role, tend to have graduate degrees. It's not a hard requirement at least at my shop if you can demonstrate that you're qualified,What's the name of your shop?,I spent 6 months looking for it.,Dude, thanks a ton for your advice. I am planning to take stats, probabiliity, and algorithms next quarter. I am really trying to push myself. I also have an excellent idea about a data science project in urban planning which I will finish over the summer. I need some more knowledge to get going. Also, do you feel like there is a bubble around software engineering and that its about to burst, and how do you feel about data science? Last, I am reading job descriptions for data science interns on linkedIn and they all assume prior experience in handling large data sets. How would you recommend I get my hands dirty with big data and machine learning, cause they all are asking for prior experience and in all honesty, I have none. Right now, I could go down the software engineering line, but I dont want to waste my mind on brainless scripts, and I really want to do something creative. i feel that finding meaning in data is something I would enjoy a lot and would actually make me think a lot.,You bet. Remember, I am just one voice and there are many others with their own stories and answers, all of which are valid, so don't overweight my advice!,I'm not sure what you mean in your software engineering question so you might want to clarify. If you mean to ask whether it's hard to penetrate the field as a new grad, I'd say that it'd be easier as a new grad than it would for data science. I have a couple friends who were computer engineers and are really well off right now. Software engineering can and does require a lot of creativity, and has its own avenues into data science!,As for the data science internships, it depends how they specify prior experience... If they put a specific number of years next to it, then they're looking for someone with actual work experience or , serious school project experience. ,I think something fun you could do to dip into data would be playing around with Tableau; if you're savvy enough, then you can figure out how to get it for ""free"" hah. Lots of tutorials out there and tons of cool stuff you can do with it!,Here's a couple more tips: (1) Avoid LinkedIn for data science positions. There are probably hundreds of people applying to that same position on LinkedIn, which is why it's better to avoid the ""data science"" tags in general. Keep tabs on a variety of sites; I got mine on ,. (2) If you want to be a data scientist, make yourself look like one. Create a github account and start to build a collection of projects on there. Learn a little html/css and create a snazzy personal website to help sell yourself. These are the kinds of things that you have to have in order to stand out from the crowd, because everyone wants to be a data scientist, and recruiters only have time to chat with those who mean it.,Also, don't pigeon hole yourself in your studies. Keep an open mind and let your interests work themselves out, because there are lots of really smart people in the field from a huge variety of disciplines.,Thanks again!
I was really tired when I replied the last time, but I feel a little more fresh now. I was reading about Hadoop and Tableau yesterday. Hadoop has a lot to do with distributed computing, which I dont fully understand, so I am not going to mess with it. Tableau seemed interesting, I am going to start working with that. ,As time passes, my gitHub is looking better and better, so I am feeling great about that. ,Classes and Pigenon-holing: Granted, there are a lot of people from diverse backgrounds trying to enter the field, however, wouldn't people who have a strong cs-math, machine learning background be a lot more appealing to recruiters cause they have the base knowledge to do what companies need? Like, compared to someone who just took physics or chemistry in college? How the f**k would they be good data scientists? they could teach themselves, but then they would have gaps in their basics and would not have grinded hours and hours learning about graphs, different languages, data structures, networks, databases, algorithms, vector machines etc. Like, I am taking a Machine learning and stats course next quarter, and I know for a fact that i will learn something there that will be invaluable. ,Serious School Project: I am doing well in school so I should be able to land some research with a professor studying databases, so that should help.,Software Engineering Question: I was speaking to a senior who graduated and he feels that there is a ""bubble"" around the software engineering industry. ie There will be an over-supply and the software dev job market is about to get rekt? Do you think that does not make sense or that is a genuine possibility? If so, is the data science industry in the same realm as the software engineering industry or is Data Science/Engineering/Analyst going to continue to grow cause its a niche skillset that has a high skill and knowledge cap?,Oh, I see what you mean by bubble now. I really can't speak to whether or not this is happening, but I know a few software engineers who are really killin it right now and making some big bucks, only a couple years out of school. It's possible that the pool of software engineers is growing faster than demand, but I highly doubt the rise is so sharp that wages go flat and people cant find jobs.,Ya, with that kind of background, you will definitely look more fit for the position than a chemistry or physics student, but there are definitely physics students working their way into the field too! I just met a materials scientist over the weekend who took some courses in stats and AI, as well; lots of math/physics/engineering students know how to code and can solve really abstract/challenging problems. I'm just saying that you shouldn't focus solely on machine learning/AI because you could be exposing yourself to a variety of fields and find one you love unexpectedly; optimization, simulation, stats, machine learning, etc.,Data science will continue to grow for a very long time, until we've taught computers to teach themselves so well that they're own ability to teach themselves outpaces ours. The field is so fresh that there aren't even specific names for the roles that data scientists hold. ""Data scientist"" is just some vague placeholder for a variety of specialties.,As for the project, my advice would be to do something less theoretical and more practical. Not everyone can appreciate a highly technical data science project, but no matter where apply, everyone will appreciate a project that impacts the business. Go for simplicity and business practicality.,How relevant or useful is the aws certified solutions architect cert to a data science career?,Not that useful. That's for sysadmins and platform people. If I was interviewing someone with that on their resume, I'd be a little suspicious,What Statistics topics are the most important for data scientists to learn?,I'm currently a principle software engineer with a lot of freedom. 
For the past 12 months I've been making topic and sentiment models for our review data. 
When presented to users in ab tests (i.e allowing them to filter by topic or sentiment) It's led to some neat upticks in conversion. ,I'd like to move my career further into data science, is it worth persuing a PhD in a NLP related field or should I continue to broaden my practical experience in my current job?,I've just turned 30 with a near empty bank account and I'm faced with a big decision with 2 jobs offers - one is clearly more data science oriented than the other but pays a lot less. My resume has been really jumpy since I left school 4 years ago with a  Masters degree from a top engineering school in the US. I also hold a Bachelors in Physics with good honours. I first came across Machine Learning a year ago with Ng's Coursera course  - I completed it with a 100% grade - so this was the last time I checked that my Linear Algebra, programming, and Calculus skills are still intact. I also remembered enjoying structured programming assignments at school (but only when they worked and checkpoint was achieved, otherwise it was frustration!) and Ng's course reminded me of that a little, it was kind of fun getting the correct answers using my hidden away math and programming skills. However I am seriously deficient in stats for someone with a STEM background and couldn't understand the stuff about bias-variance tradeoff. ,Since then I've been actively thinking and trying to enter the big data / analytics job market thinking I'd have a competitive advantage with my background, and with all the surrounding hype, I'd command a high salary and build a real career rather than job hop like I did up till this point. I've been job-searching and freelancing this past year on various data related business analysis gigs with Excel, Tableau, SQL, relational DB etc. but it's only now that I have to seriously consider my options ahead with 2 solid job offers. Should I take the very low paying research institute job in a field I don't care much about for one year to learn a bunch of data science things (time series, R, Python, ML, sci-kit learn, ANN's, sql) and then aim to land a well-paying data scientist job in industry (probably finance or insurance since I'm in living asia) or can I take the very well paying job first at a tech vendor as a client service IT guy (ETL and data warehousing tasks, sql, backend stuff, some business analysis) and spend my own time learning data science and doing kaggle and end up at the same data scientist job at the end while earning some serious money? ,FYI: after i left school, spent first 2 years in teaching, and the last 2 yrs in business / consulting - but all jobs had low pay with bad companies / freelance and didn't last long.,I’m interested in data science as an eventual career and I’d like to jump right into learning coding. As a true novice, I don’t have any experience coding, but I’d like to start learning. Would it be feasible to learn one language and find an entry level coding job using that while I continue to gain experience and study independently to gain skills pertaining to data science? And if so, what would be the most useful language for me to learn that might also be able to land me a job or internship? I currently work as a nurse in a totally unrelated field but I have a LOT of free time to study and learn. I'd also be willing to consider a bootcamp if there are any out there worth the time and money. ,Python is probably one of the best all-around languages to learn first.,Start there.,Am I working more as a data analyst or a data scientist?,A bit of background - I got my MS in a social science about a year ago, and about 6 months ago got hired on as a ""risk analytics program lead"", a position that didn't exist before I filled it.  My first task was to build and evaluate a model to identify certain members of a segment of our client population for further evaluation, and my next project is to do the same thing for the other four segments of our client population.    In between I've kept myself busy by doing anything from creating a map projection to visualize the geographical spread of client segments to pulling information from our database to stratify and classify portions of clients segments, as well as write academic articles on how and what I'm doing.,I never expected to wind up in data science, and I came into this position with only the most basic programming skills and not having taken a math class since high school.  I largely got hired on because I'm smart and have insane amounts of knowledge about this particular domain/field I work in.  ,I'm trying to fill in the gaps of my knowledge by learning python (I came in with some knowledge of R, but as soon as I started working with python, oh my god, so much easier) and statistics, but I don't even know how to classify what I do!!!,How would you guys classify me/my job based on what I said above?,Currently working on a 2nd bachelor's in Data, and I was curious if anyone working in the field had any thoughts on functional programming languages, and in particular do languages like Haskell get used at all in your day to day work? I ask because I recently have been trying to learn various programming languages, and while I am still working on Python and R, I have a strong interest in functional programming and think it's really interesting. ,I'm glad you're interested in functional programming. That innate curiosity should tell you're in the right field. :) It's a good use of your time to take a deep dive into understanding the motivation, implementation, pros, and cons of functional programming (FP) and object-oriented programming (OOP). That will help you tremendously when you get into program architecture. ,I bring up program architecture because it will make you a better programmer in R and Python. Broadly speaking, R is an FPL and Python is an OOPL. A solution in Python will absolutely crash and burn in R, and vice versa. Your research into programming architecture will help to navigate these problems.,With regard to Haskell, , few data scientists would use Haskell to implement a real solution. Python/R, SQL, and Hadoop are the big programming skills in data science. ,That said, by all means, put some time into Haskell. It's instrumental nowadays to understanding FP. But know that even a mastery of Haskell will not earn you a job in data science.,Is it worth for me to get a Master's in Statistics?,Below are my experiences:,I don't consider mathematics to be my focus but I don't want to be a pure programmer who doesn't understand mathematics.,Would getting a Master's in Statistics help me when I enter industry full-time as a data scientist? I want to be able to rise within a company while still doing technical work.,IMO no. What do you expect to achieve by getting this degree?,So much for the signalling value of the degree. But of course you may want to get the degree for the sake of the education itself. In that case, it matters whether you want to learn the specific things taught in your courses or do you want to become better at math in general.,Bottom line is: no one will give you Official Permission To Do Data Science. If you want to do it then do it. Pick a project that you think is cool and that you will enjoy and do it. If at any point you encounter something that your lack of knowledge of stats prevents you from doing - then you can stop and study the relevant piece of stats. This way you won't be falling asleep over a textbook, you will always be studying something that is relevant to your project. You will save time on learning things that you don't need and you will learn other things that you do need and that are not covered in the curriculum. By the end of the project you will have something cool to show for your hard work, not just some certificate. You may learn less stats this way but the things that you will have learned will have been reinforced by experience. You will understand them better, you will be able to explain them better and they will stay with you longer.,Premature education is the root of all evil."
"Please post your questions here instead of creating a new thread. Helps keep the sub clean :),Thread will stay alive until next one so keep posting after the date in the title.,Thanks to everyone for answering questions!,Type of Questions that fit here:,Link to Wiki that contains Questions & Answers from previous weeks:,I have 7 years of data analysis, forecasting and statistics while working in the earth sciences. I have an MS in Civil Engineering. I know R, Python and SQL. I am taking the time to learn Hadoop and Spark. ,What else should I do to transition to a data science position? How would you recommend selling this experience given that it is not ""pure"" data science?,I think technically you are already a data scientist ,You probably have sufficient mathematics and data pipelines experience.,Refresh your linear algebra and convex optimization if you're rusty, and work through the microeconomics book from Hal Varian to get a feel for the mathematics behind utility curves (also helps beef up chops to explain the math in a simple way to execs). Also some time spent in , is time well spent.,Some basic knowledge of statistics is always helpful! Outside of that, it sounds like you've got a solid base. ,What portion of jobs are telecommute? And which cities (in US) are decent hubs for the profession, outside of the SF Bay Area?,This is somewhat biased from my personal experience, but most big cities on the East cost seem to have lots of jobs. NYC, Boston, DC, Charlotte, Raleigh, and Atlanta for example. ,Dallas, Tampa, Atlanta, Nashville (Healthcare data jobs), Chicago, Seattle, LA, Denver (oh man, so much in Denver), Houston, Toronto, Portland.,I'm finishing a chemistry degree and then planning to learn R. I've never coded before in any meaningful way. What else will it take to become a data science? ,I have plans to follow a few programs, you know the ones. ,What do I need to know? ,You'll want to understand basic statistical inference. How much stats do you understand? Not just OLS, but do you understand the differences between logit and probit models? Do you know what robust and clustered standard errors are? I'm a fan of Wooldridge's ,. Start with that. There's actually and R version of the book online now! ,You'll want to learn to program too; R is a necessary but insufficient tool for most data science jobs. Python is good. ,I could go on, but those are the big two. ,Well, my dad is a recently-retired graduate professor of statistics at an ivy league college (I am not an ivy-league student) but I've told him that when I graduate in december he is going to sit down and give me classes on stats. ,I was going to start with R. I heard R is great for data visualization. A little more technical to use than python, but its also less common and therefor pays better. Job searching for R programmers yielded an average of 15 grand more than python. I intend to learn both but start with R, unless I'm talked out of it. ,My initial gameplan: Graduate with a chem degree, take stats from dad, and go through datacamp and The Art of R Programming by Matlock. These are not my only influences but they will be the ones I start with. Is there anything in this that I may look back on and wish I'd done differently?,Further, what is it like working as a data scientist? What is your daily routine like? Weekly? ,Full disclosure: I'm a fourth-year undergrad. I'm only starting my first data analyst internship this summer. That said, I've taken time to talk to a lot of professionals in the area (Midwest), successful students, etc. I won't pretend to have all the answers, but I'm confident I understand the expectations.,You're right, ,. Base R is certainly more technical, but packages like dplyr, tidyr, etc. make it easier. ,Careful not to conflate populations. Jobs which rely heavily on R are different from roles which rely on Python. Learning R to earn more is missing the point, I think. Historically, R has been used by a more statistically-trained crowd (academics, researchers and the like). ,There are many paths to Rome. I don't think you're setting yourself up for any regrets. ,Make sure you read. I don't mean just Matlock and stats books. Read blogs. Read journals. Read books. I'm interested in behavior, so I've read books on complex adaptive systems, survey methodology, etc. One book I wish I read sooner was ,. I highly recommend starting with it. Do it now, actually, before you finish your degree. It's a short book.,I'll be on the subreddit to post about my experiences in my internship - what I was prepared for, what I wasn't, etc. But again, I'm just an undergrad. We're both climbing a mountain and I'm only ten feet ahead of you. ,Also, thank you very much for taking the time to reply. ,Cross-posted from ,.  I'm not sure if this is the right thread, but it has to do with job interviews so I'm posting it here.,After bombing a bunch of interviews, I'm realizing that I'm not good at quickly looking at a problem and data, deciding on variables to look at, and building a classifier or a regressor. Given a week or so, I can easily build something useful and people like it, but I'm not good at working on a crunch. I'm also terrible at verbally expressing my brainstorming process.  I tend to think more laterally than linearly, so it seems like I'm unfocused and clueless when I'm just exploring a lot of possible options.,Is there a book or a website with a bunch of data analysis questions where I can brainstorm solutions?,I'm looking at questions along the lines of ""Given a list of perfectly-spelled character names from fantasy books, build a model to predict whether or not new names are missing apostrophes."" and ""Given a bunch of celebrities and their dates of death, build a model to predict how many celebrities will die in 2017."",Note that I'm finishing up a master's degree in statistics.,You're discouraged. I can empathize with that. Hopefully my two cents is worth something; I'll admit I'm not by any means an authority on the jobs you're applying for. ,But I assure you, any MS Stats program worth the money has taught you the skills you need to do what you're asking. ,Google scholar. There are a lot of great papers with creative methodologies. Read some in the field you're interested in. I'd be astounded if you haven't already done this dozens of times in your degree program. ,An easier solution may be this: Understand that the job your pursuing is probably looking to you to eschew uncertainty. It doesn't sound like you're doing that in your interviews. It sounds like you're conflating ""I have a problem"" and ""I want a solution"" to mean, ""I want the best, end-solution right now."" ,Interviewers aren't asking that. If you can do that, great, but they're not asking for the best end-solution. ,Interviewers are asking you to brainstorm a solution that's in the right ballpark. Give them one (maybe two) good approaches that come to mind and detail , you think they are good approaches. ,You have the skills. Don't discount yourself.,Thanks!  That's what I've been trying to do.  I had one interview where I kept giving suggestions (the question was along the lines of the first one I had above), and the interviewer kept shutting them down.  Although I think he was shutting them down to see what else I'd come up with.,I've done this with a few papers and I'm good at immediately recognizing when a technique like Poisson regression or survival analysis makes sense.  But I shut down at more ""out there"" problems.,If his critiques were thoughtful and meaningful, consider it a learning experience. Else, I think you're right about him prodding you for more answers. I wouldn't let it bother you in that case. ,I think that's something we all struggle with. I personally find some ridiculous questions irritating, but they give you a chance to be creative and practice critical thought. I found , to be a good inspiration. ,This is tangentially related, but I think it's helped me become a better critical thinker. In the last six months I've been reading a , of sports literature and a , of inference in just blatantly wrong. So I started reading papers and writing in the margins why I thought certain approaches were wrong. When certain statements were dubious, I googled it; sometimes I was surprised! ,The point here isn't that there's a lot of awful stats out there; the point is that you refine your understanding of the statistics. Even better, you'll occasionally find ingenious methodology to apply to your own work. ,To digress, critical thinking is a learned skill. Practice it. ,Thanks!  On the bright side, I ended up getting another interview, so I didn't do as bad as I thought.,[deleted],Never heard of it. Our firm primarily uses an established recruiting pipeline from the North Carolina State program. Who recruits from Northwestern/where are they placing?,Here's a ""What do you think of XXXXX data science bootcamp?"" question:,$7995 for full-time (2 months) or hybrid (5 months, online and meet on-site 1x/week); scholarships available but I think no more than $3-4k max.,As for me, I don't think it's for me as I'm not really at the point where I have figured out whether this is the career field I want to go into and thus can justify paying this much money just to learn more. My plan is to start with free resources this summer.,So, I guess I'm interested in hearing impressions on this program in general.,Not worth the money.

You won't be able to vote or comment.,Hey everybody,,This is my story.,I have a background in computer science; my undergrad was in computer science as was my masters and Ph.D from Rice University in Houston, Texas. Then I started working as a programmer/developer in a startup around 2009. ,While I was a programmer I realized that I wanted a career change, at least a change in direction. I got curious about data science after taking some machine learning classes online via ,, and realized I wanted more! Eventually I took classes with Stanford via their , (SCPD). During that time I gradually switched jobs from a software developer to a data engineer to a data scientist. I've been a full-time data scientist for about 4 years now.,Let’s clarify what data science is here: a combination of statistics, programming and business communication skills that combine together to help people analyze massive datasets at scale to unearth business insights. ,It was actually pretty interesting how I got my first role: I started a ,, where I was based at the time, and gradually got recognized as an expert in the field. When there were open data science job opportunities, people came to me! Naturally, when I found something I liked, I offered my skills up -- and since then I haven’t looked back.,I’m now the Director of Data Science Education at ,. We just launched the ,, a data science bootcamp with a job guarantee, because I believe in helping others make the same journey I did. ,BTW, here are some awesome resources to get you started!,P.S. Thanks for all the love. I'm new to Reddit, and am amazed by the response and the community.,As an undergrad computer science student, are there any specific internships or job opportunities you would recommend looking out for to become more involved in data science as a career?,I'd recommend looking for internships where you work as a software engineer, but with teams that work closely with data scientists or on data science pipelines (i.e. implementing and scaling data science tools that someone else has written). Many of these positions are often called ""data engineer"".,I'm from a more or less purely business education and landed in a position where my job centers around data analysis. I only recently started, but I'm beginning work with SQL (Querying only, no ""back end"" table management). Aside from this, I don't have any coding experience. I've started taking a Python on Coursera, but it will be some time until I'm proficient. What sorts of skills and/or courses should I be looking into to move in the direction of a data science career, as I don't see myself moving forward from my current position without more computer science skills. ,Data Science can really be achieved with simple scripting skills (So look at Python, Perl, and R) and understanding query languages (SQL being the goto). If you want to know a simple stack to work with start with just python and SQLite (don't worry about the database admin at first, though that can become part of your job). With python, look at libraries like matplotlib and other ways to visualize the data. This leads to R and in general showing statistical significance (which is how you ""prove"" things empirically). ,I think the biggest difference, and , can correct me on this, is that data science actually requires you to think more about mathematics and algorithms versus other software engineering. This has it's ups and it's downs. A large pool of scientific tools for data science are nothing more than scripts. Finding a nicely structured project is rare but likewise, most data processing is a ""pipeline"" like structure, so scripts work nicely because you can just feed the results from one script into another and along the way collect all your metrics in your database.,So don't fret too much on software engineering, these skills can be a plus but the main focus is to get good at scripting up processes using python or perl while equally becoming familiar with database concepts (mainly queries). Picking up skills in NoSQL (bad term) or R can help but the basics are just scripting and querying.,Agree with this response completely. While data science does require some programming skills, most of it tends to be writing large scripts rather than building production-grade software. So the amount of Python you need to learn is far lesser than you think.,What's more important for you, after you get some basic proficiency in Python, is to pick up some of the other skills associated with DS, including the statistics, machine learning, algorithms and so on.,Most data scientists in industry use Python or R. There are enough opportunities with both. I'd recommend picking one you like and getting better at at. Eventually you might want to learn both, but it's not necessary.,Thank you!,As someone in the exact scenario as ,, this is extremely helpful. Thank you so much.  ,In a Windows environment with SQL please learn PowerShell! Can we just kill Perl already? ,Perl is more of an old dog trick. If you are starting now python is much better. I have never used much PowerShell but it's utility seems to be growing. The main reason to go with something like python, is the community and ecosystem. I don't know how hard it is to interact with different backend databases with PS But in python, there are numerous options for almost any type of DB, with a few solutions even trying to be dialect agnostic which can help a lot when porting.,+1 I wouldn't be putting any effort into Perl.,Pick Python or R - it really doesn't matter which but I prefer Python since it's a bit more flexible so gives you more things you can do at first.  Don't try to learn both at once, you'll just make life difficult for yourself.,Eventually though, you will want to know both.  They each have their strengths and weaknesses and being more versatile is going to help you to work more productively.,Agree 100%.,Python tends to be better at building production-grade software, and it has easier syntax for beginners (IMO, syntax is a matter of taste). R, however, is still miles ahead when it comes to visualization tools such as ggplot2 and basic statistics libraries.,nice, and it's Python 2 we need, not 3, correct?,They're both fine. Python 3 needed some time to catch up on library compatibility, but now it's pretty much there.,oh. Cause I have the data science from scratch book. Would it make sense to just follow the book or are we talking about the same thing? And if I do, will I be behind somehow?,I think you nailed it. I've used Python, but I manage Windows servers. PowerShell is still growing into most everything I the Windows ecosystem. In fact Microsoft is implementing open SSH in PowerShell 5 in Windows 10.,Thank you so much!,Are you me? ,Data Science can really be achieved with simple scripting skills (So look at Python, Perl, and R) and understanding query languages (SQL being the goto).

Picking up skills in NoSQL (bad term) or R can help but the basics are just scripting and querying.,What was the most fascinating project you worked on (that you can share)? What kind of datasets did you use and what did you learn from it? ,When I was working as Chief Data Scientist at a company that prevents phone fraud, I worked on a very cool proof-of-concept that eventually got turned into a product and got us a patent.,The company's primary product was preventing phone fraud in call centers by analyzing the audio of phone calls. However, we had a prospective customer come to us one day and tell us that they suspected that fraudsters were mining their IVR (i.e. automated menus) using bots. Basically, a bot would try various numeric combinations against account numbers to find the right PINs, and then collect private information about their customers.,The prospective customer provided a really large data dump of 6 months of activity in their IVR, and wanted us to both verify their hypothesis and if verified, find a way to prevent it. It took me several months of work, but I came up with a really cool machine learning technique to identify the mining patterns used by fraudsters and distinguish them from patterns of regular users of the IVR.,Eventually, this research was further developed, patented and incorporated into the company's core product. I also presented this work as a talk at Black Hat, a top cybersecurity conference.,Link to patent and presentation?,This is the product based on the work: ,Hi there.,A few questions if you don't mind:,1) , for those looking for a job. , for those just getting started with little technical background.,2) If you go on upwork, there are a ton of contract opportunities for data analysis and data scientists. A lot of my friends who are data scientists in SF work as consultants too. In terms of remote work, I'd say it's about the same as software engineering. In fact, the cross-functional nature of work in data science can make it a bit harder to work remote in a full-time role.,3) I think pretty much every software engineer I know nowadays wants to learn at least some data science. So that should tell you something :-),I applied, but I don't think I am a qualifying candidate (weak statistics and programming), but I have a lot of time on my hand if I was to be accepted. ,I looked at your guy's website, and had a couple of more questions if you don't mind:,IN YOUR OPINION, which path do you recommend for new grads?,Assuming you don't have a strong technical degree, I'd recommend looking at companies or teams where data is used to support the core product (think roles such as marketing analytics, sales analytics and so on) rather than being part of the core product. The bar for those roles is a bit lower. ,In addition, I'm a huge fan of making a step-by-step transition i.e. find a role which uses your current skills but has a data component, and negotiate a learning budget with your employer that you use for acquiring more skills. That way, you're not going back to school and running up a huge debt (not to mention spending a lot of time) in order to build a career for yourself.,As an almost grad I find myself in this position. I work part time programming on systems that are less enjoyable and not what I want to work on in the long run, while I finish my uni degree. I am doing a machine learning based final year project for my Honors degree next year, but otherwise I am well short on stats and similar. I have been starting on small projects on Kaggle to try and work out how things work, but I am wanting to look for a more direct approach. ,What kind of key words in a job description would give you an indication that the company may be more open to allowing staff some time to train or gain experience in a new direction, such as data science?,It's a hard question to answer from a job description, unless they explicitly look for a position such as Junior/Entry-level/Associate Data Scientist. Many large companies with huge data analyst/scientist teams have lots of entry-level positions. Think telecom companies such as AT&T and Verizon, or technology consulting firms such as IBM, Accenture and Deloitte.,My preferred approach is to actually network and do informational interviews. You can get a lot more of the tacit information about company cultures by talking to people who currently or previously have worked in a company.,Meetups are a great way to start to build your network and find these kinds of positions.,Thank you! That sounds like an excellent way to start working in that direction ,Not OP, but I have a lot of technical backgrounds and here's my random 2 cents.,You can self-learn SQL, Python, R, administration, efficiency, etc. But in data science and reporting, a lot of places want to see mathematics degrees from colleges regardless of experience.,SQL is a good start, Python is more versatile but R is more linked to SQL Server. ,Khan Academy is a great resource. I used it a lot in college to help with learning statistics.,What made you transition from data science to software engineering? Did you know about Data Science before taking the classes on Coursera?,The main reason for me to transition was that I was interested in more than just coding. While coding is fun and fascinating in its own right, I wanted a career that involved more business, product and communication skills.,Data Science wasn't actually my first choice. I looked into management consulting quite seriously and got quite a ways through the process of getting a consulting role. However, I had to take a deep look at what I wanted out of life at that point and realized I wasn't cut out for the 80-100 hour workweeks and the travel that consulting entails. ,Data Science was the second thing I looked at, starting with the Machine Learning course on Coursera when it was first launched. Haven't looked back since then :-),What does your typical week look like? How much time do you spend on programming vs. doing communication / business-y stuff?,It depends on what level you're at. As a junior data scientist or analyst, I'd mostly work on programming or analysis tasks that my manager would assign to me (much like a typical engineering setup). I'd say that in that case, it would be 80% programming vs. 20% business-y stuff. As a senior data scientist, it was about 50-50. As a lead data scientist, the equation flipped and it was 20% programming and individual work and 80% management/business/communication work.,Also, an answer I posted on Quora recently: ,Eh, he transitioned from Software Engineering to Data Science. Not the other way around.,Could you explain some differences between data science & business intelligence? ,There appears to be some overlap but some differences as well. ,Could a BI Analyst transition easily to DS?,Thanks.,I think some of the skills are definitely transferable. For example, the general business thinking, ability to work with real data, hypothesis-driven decision making are all transferable skills and mindsets.,However, data science requires a few more skills beyond that. First of all, a data scientist has to be fluent at at least one ""real"" programming language, typically Python or R, in contrast to Excel or Tableau or other BI tools. Secondly, a data scientist has to understand stats a bit more deeply than applying standard rules or formulas. And third, a data scientist typically has to be familiar with the foundations of machine learning: think regression, classification and clustering at the very least.,Oh, i want to hear more about this!  I did BI work almost a decade ago and then ended up staying home because my kids just really needed me.  I'm finishing up a degree (because i didnt have one) and i""m trying to figure out what the prospects are for BI/Data science.  My degree is actually data analytics/data science but includes no stats, and a little R and more Python.  i've taken an online R course before.  ,Not in the job market yet because i need to have the confidence of having the degree,You're doing great! There are huge opportunities for all kinds of data and business analytics roles right now.,Do you drive a Ferrari,LOL, no. I live in the middle of San Francisco. I don't need a car :-),Hello! I am a computer science student. My university offers a data science specialization where my upper-level courses focus more on information processing. I am taking an intro to data science now and I really enjoy the content. If you are interested in what an undergraduate data science course looks like here is our schedule:,I will be applying for summer internships in the spring and I was wondering if you could offer any advice on what sort of internship would help me on a path to data science. Is a typical software engineering internship a good start or would I want to look to find an internship as a data analyst? And how do you feel about grad school for data scientists? I feel slightly overwhelmed  with the data science pipeline and feel an undergraduate degree is not sufficient. Thank you for your time!,If you are a computer science student I would recommend a ""data engineer"" type of position. This is pretty similar to a software engineering position (and it may be even called that in some companies), but you work more on data related pipelines and technologies such as Hadoop, Spark, Kafka etc. ,Basically, you want to find something that uses your skills 50%, and lets you learn new things 50%. ,About grad school, it depends on how deep you want to get into data science. A great grad school program such as CMU or Stanford will let you learn about theoretical aspects of DS far more deeply and let you work at the cutting edge of data science (think AI and so on). However, you may not know right now whether you want that, or want to be more applied.,I'd recommend trying a couple of jobs first, and then considering grad school if you really want to go deep into the field.,This is excellent advice. Thank you.,REUs (Research Experiences for Undergraduates). Look for these in bioinformatics or computational chemistry/physics in particular. Also look at internships at national labs, again in bioinformatics. Some sub-fields in bioinformatics would be anything pan-omics (proteomics, genomics, etc). All of these fields generate huge datasets that need to be analyzed. ,Thanks! Thats a good idea. My instructor works in our bioinformatics on campus I will reach out to him. ,I'm in Atlanta earning a PhD in a social science as a second career (I'm in my early 30s). I've become very interested in the stats side of things. Have taught myself some R and Python, have prior experience in business consulting. Sometimes I fantasize about moving into data science or some junior version of it, but I worry that it'd be too much of a reach given that I don't have a comp sci or stats degree, and I also wonder about what kind of jobs I could find in Atlanta. I'm thinking my best first step would be to attend the meet-up here if it's still going strong in your absence. Would appreciate any other encouragement, cautions, perspective, or suggestions you might have for someone in my situation. Thanks!,What kind of social science do you work on and at which school? There are plenty of jobs in industry that combine qual/quant research -- they're typically called design research, UX research, user research or product research. These are positions that combine social science (qualitative) skills with quantitative skills -- and pay as well as a software engineer or a data scientist. I suggest you take a look at that.,Thank you for the response. It's psychology, and I'm at Georgia State. Could have gone to Emory or Georgia Tech with my scores and grades, but GSU was the only one with the type of program I was interested in. It's a scientist-practitioner program, so I also do clinical training (i.e. therapy) in addition to research. The research I'm involved with (personality psychology) is considered quantitative, although we often create and use survey instruments on the front end, which is where the numbers for analysis come from. I'll take a look at those job titles and roles; thank you for the suggestions. My student loans are outstripping the earnings potential for a therapist, and I can only do psych testing and evaluations for so many hours a week. Even aside from money, I think I'd be dissatisfied if my analytical side were put on a shelf after school.,What exactly do you..do? I know R to it's basics  (I did my statistics project on predicting the value of the compressive strength of concrete using an online data set) but I'm not sure how I would use it for anything useful. Also what do you need SQL for? I didn't even know R could work with SQL. ,A lot of companies use SQL servers to store their transactional data. Very often, an analyst or data scientist may need to pull the data from the system themselves in order to do their analysis/modeling/machine learning. This is why you may need to know SQL. Data isn't always conveniently sitting on JSON flatfiles for you to process through R. Many companies were smart enough to collect all their data, but weren't smart enough or are too cheap to have a proper big data strategy. ,That's actually not convenient. You could have 1 million records in a flat file and you only want to 100. If I write an R script that works with the flatfile, I have to iterate the full 1 million records, just to do computations on my 100. With databases, there is this magical concept called an index that reduces the time complexity associated with such operations.,Js objects don't have an index? ,You can build objects in memory that work like databases because an index is really just a hash. However the issue is that you have to build this in memory and then load the file with the hashes anytime you run the code. That or you come up with a complex way to segment the file, essentially like a fixed length *array. A database handles all this for you and almost any flavor *has a cache, so even if you do design a comparable schema in flat files, you still would have to write a caching algorithm and manage that. The question simple is why repeat all this work either at a project level or runtime. Download your flat file, parse it into.a database, and thereafter you have an efficient system for asking questions. A query is a question, so why in God's green earth people avoid it when asking data questions, is mind blowing. Use a query, which means you have a database... not all dbs are equal but plenty are dead simple.,SQL can work with anything. This is kind of like general system design. Any computer system has effectively three components, a front-end, a back-end, and a database. The database here can be a bit vague because in complex systems you have caches and in-memory data versus on disk. So almost any data science job requires interacting with a database, as that's where the data is stored... Most big systems use SQL but NoSQL systems are also possible. In general a person who understandings SQL understandings the concept of a Query Language and as such, can normally adapt to other Query Languages pretty easily. Mainframes like IBM have other Query Languages but most now support SQL. SQL is the goto standard though there are different dialects and these can have rather different options and behaviors. Best to start with the simplest which most people will point you to SQLite (which is basically a file-based database used by a number of different products, including a lot of web browsers).,I understand what SQL and what it does but I'm not sure how that relates to R or big data. ,If I have a data file I want to do statistics on I just...import that data file. ,Which means, you don't understand. ,Then you have the wrong format for big data.,Look at something like ,. That's big data. Then go look at downloading the datafiles and tell me how it's time efficient to search a multiple gig file to find 10 sequences. Then, realize that anytime you have a big dataset, you want to load it into a system that efficiently organized the data. Now you know what a database is, which is what a query language is for, which is exactly what you store big data in...,Oh.,That's a lot of data. I thought large data was a couple thousand or a couple hundred thousand data points. But that's 50 gigs of just..what even is in those files? ,NCBI data is split up into a number of databases. Some of these are gene related, so it has a genetic sequence, some descriptor about what the sequence codes, and the taxonomic information about where the sequence was collected. Another example is proteins which are again sequences but now we are talking proteins, so their is a function (instead of a gene which codes for a protein), and then again the taxonomic information. There maybe other tidbits too about when it was discovered, or even more complicated things than I understanding, which relates to how things can be structured or relate biologically (like clusters of genes that have a relationship). To summarize there is about a page of data for each gene or protein and most of that data is related to other data (which again is why having tables and a query language helps).,Let's look at an example though real quick to give you an idea of a scale:,This is a protein in humans. It's identified simply as 1X0V_A (a unique idea for the protein). In the NCBI entry, we have everything from the full species classification of a Homo sapien, to structure information about sheets and helixes in the protein structure (if you don't understand this maybe try to play the game fold-it to learn a bit), to when the protein was discovered and by whom. Up at the top you can also download the ""FASTA"". In bioinformatics, more than likely this is all the data people want unless they are doing something more complex. ,. A name and a sequence. Sometimes it's better structure than this and it's easy to know what the organism is but here the organism is just in the name, so if you wanted to build a databases from the FASTAs you would need to use the unique protein ID to look up the organism this protein is from (because it's kind of a bad idea to try to search the proteins name for that info). It's actually a rather poor name because the name includes more the description of the research which goes back to tertiary structure of the protein and when we are looking at fasta we just want the sequence, primary structure, and this paper is dealing with structural complexity beyond that.,Okay so now we see just how much data is available for one protein... so how many proteins do we have in the database?, and that is just for Homo sapien. One species...,That is just one database and in panomics, you need to reference multiple databases (e.g. connect things like the gene to the protein). Here is taxonomy browser that shows the counts for all the databases: ,. There are 167 million SNPs... 219 thousand genes. ,So with all this data, there is a lot of information about pretty much everything we know biologically about a given species and where the research comes from. ,This brief explanation also doesn't talk about cleaning up the database, as some of those sequences maybe relatively junk for your work. More so, it doesn't describe the dataset of a given experiment. when sequencing a new organism, you actually have thousands of sequencing (and these numbers grow as we do more deep sequencing). This is because each sequence maybe a partial or may have some error with reading the nucleotide or amino acid. ,Sequencing is a hell of a data challenge and it's at the core of modern biology which is why resources like NCBI exist.,Yes so at most large organisations the data you want to do statistics on is in data warehouses and you need to extract the data you want, often creating a data set from multiple tables and sources; which is what you use SQL for. Chances are you might even need to clean up and format the data which you can do in SQL or SAS or python. Data prep is 80% of peoples jobs that work in data science/analytics.,Here's a Quora answer that I wrote. Might be useful: ,How's the pay from what you have seen.,On the whole, better than a software developer with the same experience level, since DS is a harder skillset to find.,This might help: ,Could you contrast online programs such as Coursera and , with traditional university Masters degrees. Which prepares you better for a career in Data Science? Which would you recommend to an undergraduate Software Engineer looking to switch into Data Science?,It depends on what kind of data science you want to do. Online bootcamps can be a quick, time-bound way to gain enough skills to get many kinds of data science jobs, but some of the most prestigious jobs will still be out of reach. ,Basically, certain kinds of data science jobs (I call them ""Product"" roles) where you'll be working on the core product of a company have a higher bar. If that's what you want to get to eventually, by all means go to grad school. ,On the other hand, the majority of DS jobs are in the ""Insight"" category, where you're supporting the product but are not critical to it. More often than not, you're providing useful insights to sales, marketing and product teams. These jobs have a lower bar. ,I'd recommend starting with an online program, moving to a more data-science-y role than you're currently in, and then depending on what you want to do further, deciding to go to grad school or now.,Here's a Quora answer I wrote recently that might also be useful:,What do you think of Scrapy?,Scrapy is a good tool for web scraping. But as a data scientist, I frown upon web scraping in general since the data collected that way tends to be very difficult to clean, and the data collection system has to be constantly maintained.,How much do you do/work with machine learning? ,All the time in my case, especially in fraud detection! However, that can differ widely among jobs. If you're working in a role where you're supporting the product (e.g. find the best performing customer segments so sales can target better), you may not use ML that much -- instead sticking to exploratory analysis and inferential statistics instead.,Are the jobs there?,There are so many fields right now that are only beginning to taste the data science revolution. Think conservative fields such as healthcare, insurance, banking (especially the consumer side), security, logistics, agriculture and so on. The jobs are there, and will be there for a while!,Isn't data science similar to what actuaries have their hands in?,There's an overlap. Actuaries tend to create a lot of stats-based forecasting and risk models, but they don't typically (in my knowledge) use a lot of machine learning, and there's less of a business function in the role. The tools also differ, with data scientists having more general programming skills vs. using specialized statistical tools. Again, AFAIK.,I see that you're a PhD. Are there jobs for undergrads?,Plenty! Most data scientists I know don't have PhDs or even a Masters. See this answer. ,Not personally related to Data,,but this is a typical question, what would be your advice to beginners in general when it comes to learning about programming/coding? (Try and stay away from the typical ""just keep practicing"" approach if possible :P),Currently almost in my last week of community college in a System Analyst program and I'm struggling with Java more so Objects, methods, etc.. They're just not clicking whatsoever. Tried getting help with a tutor but nothing.,I hear you. The ""just keep practicing"" advice doesn't often detail what to practice and how! Here's what I suggest:,1) Pick up just the basics of the language. Typically, most programming books on a specific language cover the basics of the language in Chapter 1.,2) After that, just learn things as you need them for specific tasks. You can buy a ""Cookbook"" for that language, or just use Google and StackOverflow with questions like ""How do I do X in Java?"" Feel free to copy and paste code from the web, and try to rewrite that specific piece of code to understand it.,Basically, I'm an advocate of learning by doing and as needed, little bits at a time, rather than picking up a book or tutorial and trying to go through it from beginning to end. That latter approach only works for hardcore programming geeks, not for most other people, in my experience. ,Good luck!,If you're starting off, Java might be a bit tough to wrap your head around.,I would recommend giving Python a go - you still will need to deal with object oriented programming, but the syntax is much more friendly for a beginner so it might help you focus on the concepts more and getting everything to 'click'.,Edit: thinking a little more, I thought sharing , might be useful.  The same approach could be used for any language.,Hey there! I am currently going to school for a Masters in Business Analytics. I know there are some subtle differences between data scientist and business analyst but I was wondering what sort of recommendations do you have to follow the data science path? My program is more statistics base with big data analysis. Do you on a daily basis work more with stats or programming? I'm learning programming now but fear I will not have enough coding experience once I'm out in the field.  Thoughts? Thank you! ,Pretty sure I missed ya but if you happen to see this....,What are the biggest skill differences between a data engineer and a data scientist? From what I know at my current role (data engineer/ontologist) statistical and predictive modeling seems to be the biggest differentiation. ,What is your favorite part of data science vs. data engineering? ,When you started the meetup, how far along in your data science ""evolution"", if you will, were you? Should I just suck it up and start going to more meetups? I feel like I should but I get a bad case of ""impostor syndrome"" because I didn't get even remotely into this field until a few years ago vs it seems like everyone else I meet has been into it from the get go. ,Thank you for all the links and references!! Hugely helpful. Definitely saving this post. ,I've worked with several amazing data engineers, and I've been a data engineer in the past. The skill sets tend to be complementary. Typically, a data scientist works with a sample of the data (in the case of large data sets), builds a model that works and codes it up as a prototype. A data engineer takes that prototype and helps deploy it at scale in production. ,A data engineer and data scientist have to be able to talk to each other. This means that the data scientist has to understand the basics of how large-scale implementations work and design algorithms accordingly. For example, Support Vector Machines (with a non-linear kernel) are practically impossible to scale without using some kind of approximate algorithms. So if I were designing a model for a large scale classification problem, I'd want to use some other method, or make sure that the approximation is good enough.,On the other hand, a data engineer has to understand the basics of data science at a high level -- at least at the level of what classification, regression or clustering algorithms are and the way they work with data. The more they understand how these algorithms work, the better they'll be able to scale them. For example, if you implement regression at large scale using Gradient Descent, you can take advantage of the fact that you can implement many of the operations in parallel or as matrix operations to scale it up.,Hi, thanks for your time. I have a MS in EE and i started off as a software engineer and made a transition to Data Engineering (main language is Python). I am currently unable to see how to make my next steps into becoming a data scientist. I do not have a PhD and my major was not compsci and I am failing how to transition from Data Engineer to Data Scientist. In my free time I work on very small projects that uses the most basic concepts in computer vision. What next steps would you recommend for someone like me?,How was the process for getting into Rice for the Masters program for CS? ,I applied and got in when applications were still on paper and cellphones didn't exist. Unfortunately that means any information I provide is probably hopelessly out of date :-(,It's all good. I'm thinking of something in the field for future growth.,thanks for all the info! as someone new to programming and recently learning about data sciences i will be happily sifting through all your amazing info!,You're welcome!,Oooh good post. I've been thinking about whether this would be something I'd want to switch to at some point.  I'm a software developer (have been for many years now) with of all things a BA in psych. I ended up taking 3 stats classes, because the geek in me rather liked them, though they weren't particularly advanced classes.  I liked math but stopped after calc, not really seeing what I'd use it for.  I've got quite a lot of sql under my belt (t-sql flavor) and good bit of .net, no Python yet.  ,How much math do you need? What level would you need to get up to?   And how is the pay scale compared to a mid/senior level programmer (but not team lead or management)?  I think it would be kind of fascinating to see what questions could be answered in the data..what stories it tells.  ,Typically, you need to basics of statistics (descriptive and inferential statistics) at the very least. After that, calculus is super useful if and when you want to understand how machine learning algorithms , work, but it's not necessary. Ultimately, every machine learning algorithm is about fitting a model optimally to a data set. And if you remember your calculus, an optimization problem is typically solved by calculating a derivative and setting it to zero (in the case of derivable functions). That's where the calculus comes in. Not necessary unless you want to get into the weeds of the algorithms, but it's super useful then.,Typically a data scientist gets paid more than a programmer at the same seniority level and other factors being the same, simply because it's a more valuable and harder-to-find skill set.,For someone with a bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics is there any hope for me to land a decent job in this field? What would your recommend for me to get on track? I'm currently a cheaply paid QA Analyst and I can't seem to find a job that will pay me fairly. ,Thanks for this inspirational post. I'm excited to check out your website, which I'll do tomorrow,One of the people who I think of as a bit of a visionary in data science is Aaron Swartz. In particular, it's argued that the data he was downloaded he was hoping to use to find a link between funding of research and scientific results (to quantitatively try to find the connection between funding and results). As someone who has supported scientists with data analysis, this question in particular seems like a profound and helpful question to wrap our heads around. ,My question is, is there any dataset (collected or not yet collected) that you absolutely fascinated with and have an interest in finding patterns with in? Do you have any intuition into what you mind find or hope to find?,Do you know any people you would claim to be somewhat ""visionary"" in the realm of data science? Who is the Erdős of data science? ,Great question! I'm fascinated by all of the data produced by the Sunlight Foundation (though I've not worked with it myself). Great tool for promoting government accountability and transparency. ,I don't know if I'd call anyone the Erdos of DS. There are many rockstar data scientists around, but they tend to be known as much for their outsized personalities as for their actual technical work. Perhaps some of the Deep Learning luminaries such as Geoff Hinton? ,Thanks for your reply.,Sadly I never gained too much experience with machine learning. At a philosophy and theory level, I am very interested in computational creativity but that seems like a rather different beast than deep learning. I think I never picked up much machine learning when supporting as a data scientist because my mentor abhorred the idea of a priori from a programmatic stance. I will have to read a bit more on Geoff Hinton. The Sunlight Foundation sounds great too, I can definitely support the idea of more government transparency myself.,If you have any good reads on Geoff Hinton's work, I would appreciate any you may recommend. ,Hi ,, thanks for doing this.,I went to graduate school for Molecular Biology and shifted to neuroscience. I had statistics but nominal (basically for research purposes). Due to financial reasons, I switched to a role in data analytics. It's been 3 years and I lead a team of 10 in my company offering really basic analytics. Almost everything bar a few insights can be generated on Excel just that the volume of data is too big to do so. Thus I use R, Python and SQL. ,I feel i'm limiting myself because the companies aren't looking for any advanced analytics and another none of my superiors have experience with large volumes of data. I wish to study more by applying for a formal Data Science course in Europe or US. ,Do you think it's a good idea? The job market is pretty dim for immigrants(expats) and I can't have a student loan on my head and not have a job. Although I feel I'm in the right job, I have this fear of being left behind, not only because of a lack of formal training but also because I can't find a proper mentor who can help me with these things. ,What's the best way to learn R for someone with a software engineering background?
Can you recommend courses, books or websites? ,I'd recommend Datacamp's R courses. ,Springboard actually has a partnership with Datacamp where if you join us as a student, you get datacamp free for a month, and you can work with an R mentor. ,Do all data scientists have to do machine learning? I am interested in data science but i feel like machine learning might be a lot more difficult.,Definitely not to both questions.,i have a very vague idea of data science. the only part i understand is what i think is called the data munging part - wherein you import your data and get it ready for processing. what happens after?,imho data science is a fancy name for analytics. data munging/data prep is getting your data set ready for running analysis/modelling on etc,oh okay. nice to know.,The part that you're referring to is typically referred to as ""Data Wrangling"" and it's part of the data science process. ,Not in all cases. But typically to call yourself a ""data scientist"" you have to have some machine learning skills.,Machine Learning is not as hard to get started in as you think. There are plenty of great books and resources out there that can get you started at a level that doesn't go crazy deep. This is one of my favorite books: ,Every major language nowadays has machine learning libraries: Python and R being the most popular ones. You can get started by simply learning to apply those libraries, and then go deeper as you need.,thank you for the reco. will check it out.,Hi! I'm a software engineer who loves science and I'm looking at incorporating some machine learning stuff in my current position - it seems really exciting and an interesting way of improving how we do things. ,My question is, I didn't go to university (or much high school) - what do you think the most important things are that I would have missed? Is there anything I should be looking into but wouldn't know about? ,Microsoft Research NY has a program called the Data Science Summer School. If you have a minute, could you look it up (not sure if I'm allowed to link it) and share what you think of it?,Ok. I'm roughly on the same path. How long did it take and how har it was? Because it seems there a really big pit between ""Hey, here's some friendly guide on how to do cool stuff that can be used in real life right now and it's a really nice hobby"" and ""You really want a job in that field? Whereh's your phd, boy? You are in a wrong neighborhood."" ,And don't get me wrong, I'm really ok with getting PhD, I even want it... I'm just a bit afraid that by the time I will be considered qualified enough, all data science and machine learning jobs will be taken by robots.,And your price is a bit too much for me fight now(,I'd say it took me about 2 years to make the transition, overall. However, during that time I changed jobs to a 'data engineer' position with a 50% salary bump, and then finally to a data scientist position with another smaller salary bump. So the path wasn't direct, but it was steady progress.,Also, if you're working, take a look at your employer's learning budgets, or talk to HR about it. It NEVER hurts to ask nicely :-),Here's a Quora response that I wrote recently that outlines the details of my journey. ,Thank you. The quora response is really nice and insightful.,Should I not be really fluent & good in Programming before I even step into the field of data science,Programming is something that all data scientists do, but not necessarily as well as software engineers. Typically data scientists end up writing long scripts in Python and R, languages that are both easy to learn.,I'd recommend picking up the basics of Python or R from an online tutorial and that's good enough to get started. You can pick up the rest that you go along.,I am helping my friend transition from being an actuary into data science by teaching her programming. What are the key skills she should be developing and are there any roles you think an actuarial background would be particularly useful for?,[deleted],Not sure how SAS would help. It's definitely used by a subset of data scientists/statisticians, but seems to be popular only in certain industries. Learning SQL and Python are great.,More importantly, what can you work on that's an application of data science to chemistry -- whether at work or as a personal project? I know little about chemistry, but there seems to be quite a bit of application of machine learning to predict drug interactions, protein folding etc in the biochemistry space. Are there analogues of those problems in the branch of chemistry you work in?,Having a serious project or two in your portfolio that uses your current skill set with some data science thrown in can go a long way towards your pivot.,Hi! I think this field looks super interesting, but most jobs I see that relate seem to ""require"" a Masters or PhD in CS or SE. I'm aware that most people will overlook degrees in favor of technical skill, however this is a high bar. What learning and work can I do to make myself hireable? ,Hey! I just wanted to say that I'm trying my hardest to work in data science and I currently live in Atlanta. In fact I've been checking that meetup page for a few weeks now but meetings in that group seem pretty far apart. ,I also wanted to know if you (or anyone else in the thread) have looked at dataquest. It's another online guided learning tool. I've been following it for a while now and so far it's been pretty helpful.,Thanks,Hey John - I work for Dataquest.  If you have any questions feel free to DM me, otherwise you might be interested to read the opinions of some of our users on Quora:,Also, I'd love to hear what other steps you're taking to break into the field so I can give you some more detailed advice.,Hey thanks for the reply!,To give you some background, I graduated last year with a B.S. In Physics and since then I've been working in an analytical chemistry lab. I've come to really dislike my job so I'm looking for a bit of a career change.,I originally started dataquest on the 'Data Scientist' path, but after talking to a couple of people in the field I decided on the 'Data Analyst' path. From what I've heard it's easier to break into the field by securing an entry-level data analyst position. I've also heard that a large part of the work a data scientist needs to do is clean and organize data, and it looks like an analyst position would really hone those skills. ,Anyway, dataquest has been pretty helpful so far. It's not the only resource I've used, I've also purchased some books and enrolled in a couple Udemy courses.,I do think I'm about ready to at least start applying for some entry-level analyst positions. ,If you have any advice to speed up my progress or where to look for worthwhile jobs, it'd be much appreciated!,Our belief is that it's really key to build a portfolio of projects to demonstrate your skills.  We have a ,.,Also keep an eye on our blog for a new post on our blog that should launch in the next 24 hours, specifically on how to get a data science job!,[deleted],Take a look at this Quora response I recently wrote. Might be helpful.,Thanks for sharing your experience and useful links!!,I took some part-time data science bootcamp and currently doing coursera online course. Definitely need more work and projects before being confident to apply any data science jobs. My question is, how should I prepare for career change to data science from where I am now? Any good advice on keeping programming skills honed? Like ways to get some side data projects? Thank you! ,How much Math does a Data Scientist use? I've been reading a bit about Linear Regression, Gradient Descent, etc. (The math side of things). It's still a bit over my head but I really enjoy maths and I look forward to learning more at University.,However everyone seems to be using libraries or software like Tensorflow or scikit, where you barely need any knowledge of how the algorithms work at all (apparently). Do you use math? Is it worth it to focus on the math side of things?,Also, have you considered going into academia? Is it a common path to go from Data Scientist to Academia or the other way around? I'm interested in coming up with new algorithms and being more of a ""mathematician"" but I'm not sure it's the right path.,Yes, absolutely! If you want to go anywhere beyond just blindly applying existing libraries, you need to understand how the algorithms work. At the very least, it'll help you tune the parameters for any algorithms you do apply. As the algorithms and libraries get more complex (think of the progression from linear regression to deep learning), the number of parameters and hyperparameters increase quite a bit, and more and more of the data scientist's job is to understand and tune them better. You can't do that without knowing how they work.,Beyond just tuning algorithms, you need the math to really solve new and interesting problems, or work with specialized data sets. Many real-world problems, either in academia or in cutting-edge startups, use data that few people have worked with before, so cookie-cutter solutions rarely work. For example, when I was working in fraud detection, my team had a PhD in machine learning who spent his time coming up with innovative modifications of existing algorithms that might work in that specific data space. Not something you can do without the math.,Oh great, sounds like a very interesting career path. I still haven't started University yet so my area of interest might drift, but thanks for the insight.,Do you have any suggestions for obtaining a solid maths foundation? ,I'm an undergrad in Marketing and i have a basic knowledge in programming (C#) as a tool for my carreer. What are your recommendations on specializing in the analytical part of marketing/business? ,I'm an accounting major and I have experience with SAS, how widely used is that when compared to R or Python? ,SAS tends to be used in specialized industries (finance, insurance), since it's proprietary and expensive. Most data scientists in technology tend to use open source tools based on Python or R.,[deleted],It's all possible, but you'll have to have a really solid portfolio of projects to show for it.,Thanks for the AMA! I am on a similar career path and will be getting a B.S. in Business Analytics & Information Systems (formerly MIS at my university). My first question would be, how marketable would you say this degree is in your field?,It looks like the only languages I will be working with in school are Java and C#. I have taken online courses outside of school in Python and Ruby. In your opinion, what kind of projects would be valuable to focus on outside of school using these languages?,Thanks again for your time answering questions here! ,Python and Ruby are both very general purpose languages. Python seems better suited for data science, machine learning and statistics applications than Ruby. Ruby seems to be better for frontend web and app development. Just my 2c, I'm definitely no expert in Ruby.,Do you often see other data scientists with a masters/phd in statistics? I'm currently a data analyst that frequently uses Python/R/SQL at my current job doing very basic statistical work (nothing farther than averages, standard deviations, maybe a little predictive modeling) and visualizations while pursuing a part time M.S. in Statistics. I'm hoping one day the accumulation of my skills and the degree will allow me to interview for actual data science positions. Do you think I am following the right steps to become a data scientist? (It's my current career goal!),A masters in stats is a super strong foundation for a career in data science! ,You may still want to take an online machine learning course (say Coursera) to get the machine learning chops. Also, there's some difference in vocabulary and jargon between the fields that you'll have to get familiar with. , Data scientists almost always use 'False positives' and 'False negatives' instead of Type I and II errors. Also, data scientists tend not to distinguish between simple and multiple regression -- it's all called regression. Doing a machine learning course will help you bridge the skill gap and the jargon gap.,Thank you. :),Work on your programming skills and the machine learning parts. Create a portfolio with some real machine learning projects. An MS/PhD in stats puts you in a VERY strong position because you'll have a thorough theoretical grounding. ,To create a good portfolio, I recommend checking out our online DS programs (,) which are guided by industry mentors like myself. (,),What would you recommend to a senior that is about to graduate with a degree in statistics (with a focus on ML) from a top school hoping to break into the field? ,I've looked at a bunch of entry level positions online, and there seems to be a huge emphasis on having an advanced degree. I don't think I have the grades (my transcript is abysmal up until the last one and a half years or so) or the job experience (or the desire atm, tbh) to get into a Master's program and I'm worried about my job prospects. ,What can I do to be more competitive? ,In one word: Portfolio. Have a github portfolio with realistic projects (not just toy school projects) and work on talking and writing about them clearly and concisely.,This Quora answer might help: ,I graduated with my MS in Data Science, from a  great program, but a no name school. I would LOVE to even get an interview, but find them far and few in between. I fixed my resume according to Google engineers but still don't get too many hits back. Most of HR hardly knows the difference ebtween different positions. ,What can I do to get recognized by people who appreciate data science when I don't have a strong network?,Have a great portfolio and build your network. Recruiters and HR act as gatekeepers - their job is to filter based on standard keywords. Internal referrals are much more effective at getting interviews.,There are many ways to build your network when you don't already have a strong one:,Obviously, having a strong portfolio will help a lot when you actually connect with someone. ,I have planned too many times to learn data science from udacity. But,  lack of english kinowledge and enough patience,  I have failed each time.  Any suggestions for me? ,Hello! I am working on a project which requires mapping the emotional states of the athletes. Being a data scientist, can you recommend some source of learning the model of stats and the type of data for it. ,[deleted],See answer to a previous question: ,That might help you learn programming a bit easier. I personally always struggled with programming. One thing I wish I had realized earlier in my career was that CS is not just about programming. There are a lot of career options in CS that include algorithms, programming languages, bioinformatics and other areas that don't necessarily need crazy coding skills.,Senior computer science and applied math major here, took a job for after graduation as a software engineer at a finance company, but I think I'm going to want to get out of the straight software development area after a few years. I'm looking at master's programs in data science as a possibility. Any advice for choosing a program or figuring out what i want to do? I'm currently looking at , at the moment. I'd prefer online so I can keep working while I'm getting my masters.,IMO, you already have a lot going for you. You have the software skills, the CS and math background, and you work in a data-heavy industry (finance) which already uses data science a lot (risk prediction, fraud detection, trading strategies).,I think a Masters program may be a very heavy commitment at the outset. It's something that takes a lot of time, money and then you , get a new job. I'd recommend a more iterative path for you, given that you have so much of the prerequisites already.,I'd suggest taking some shorter courses or bootcamps in data science: whether free ones like Coursera, in-person ones like Galvanize or Insight, or online ones such as Springboard ( , ,) that'll give you just enough knowledge in a space of 3-4 months for you to switch roles within your industry to something that's closer to DS. It could be a data engineering role, for instance. Once you're there, you can make a decision on further education depending on what you like. If you want to get deeper into Machine Learning and theory, go for taking individual classes online through Stanford's continuing ed like I did (,). If you want to go more applied, you can find suitable workshops and courses for that too.,The advantage of this strategy is that it's more gradual, gives you a chance to adapt based on your needs and preferences, and has a lesser impact in terms of time and money commitment. In addition, employers are usually much more willing to reimburse shorter courses through their learning budgets. ,[removed], in , of your comments!,What you are doing is , and thus against the , of , and ,.,The reddit rules allow , such self-promotion or link in every , other contributions.

"Please post your questions here instead of creating a new thread. Helps keep the sub clean :),Thread will stay alive until next one so keep posting after the date in the title.,Thanks to everyone for answering questions!,Type of Questions that fit here:,Link to Wiki that contains Questions & Answers from previous weeks:,Looking to transition into Data Science. I've already began learning Python but I'd also like to start learning some theory that could be helpful. Any videos/books you'd suggest I look at to help understand some of the more important concepts?,Take the Harvard Data Science course, I'm through with two lectures and its got a great flow and focus on relevant topics. It is a little demanding in terms of time. If you want, we can set deadlines and work together. ,That is really great to hear. I'm starting the Harvard Data Science Cert this June. ,I'll be taking STAT S-139. Send me a PM, I'd love to work together. I'm also working full time so it'll definitely be a grueling experience; any help would be appreciated.,You should definitely also learn R,People will make suggestions for MOOCs but at the end of the day watching videos wont do anything. Get one the the Trevor Hastie books and do the exercises.,All of Statistics by Larry Wasserman if you're comfortable with calculus and linear algebra.  It's a phenomenal book for building intuition.,Is this certificate in data sceince from the UW worth , ,Depends on your current state and what you want to achieve.  If you are an undergrad that wants to get a job the answer will be very different from a PhD leaving academia who wants to show that they can do data science.,As as undergrad. ,So an an undergrad, your going to have two options -> 1) find jobs that hire undergrads and give them the title of data scientist or 2) find jobs that don't hire undergrads and convince them to hire you anyway.,For 1) having a certificate would certainly be helpful as it will show that you have given consideration to your career choice and that you've gone above and beyond other potential candidates to show you are serious about this.  Given various bootcamps and other certificates that exist, a question you would then be expected to answer is why this versus others (nano-degrees / harvard / etc).,For 2) if they're mainly a phd-hiring shop, the certificate will not convince them you can do PhD level work though it will help you be taken a bit more seriously.,In either case, what they'll really care about is what you can do and not a piece of paper that says you attended classes and did some assignments.,Which means that you need projects to showcase your skill sets in the relevant areas that you are trying to get hired into.,This does two things - gives you something to talk about and actually forces you to do some of the work that is necessary for a data science job.,I am a Master student in Business Information Management and I had two courses on ""Big Data"". This is what piqued my interest and soon I found myself finishing the Coursera ML course by Andrew Ng (which was one of the best courses I ever had btw).,So basically my skills are:
- Simple statistics
- Intermediate R
- Basic Python (but not in the context of data science)
- Some ML methods, although I feel that I know them at a high level (was actually considering trying to write my own algorithms as a way to learn as opposed to just callin svm() in R to run an SVM).,I feel completely overwhelmed at this point. Should I do a statistics course to have a more solid background in understanding the methods? Should I just look for projects on which to practice my skills and learn by running into obstacles and solving them? Should I do more ML courses? So many options, so little time...,Another question: how often do data scientists have to write algorithms as opposed to knowing which algorithm would be more suited for a certain situation and using an already optimized package instead? It seems to me that writing the algorithms from scratch is a daunting task that extremely experienced researches do, not amateur self-learners.,Take a step back and think about what you want to do.  Once you have that answer, it'll be easier to figure out next steps.,All of the things you mentioned (all the options) are great and you should be doing all of them.  However, in the interest of time/money/your goals, it's better to figure out what you actually need to do to achieve your goals (is it a job / internship) rather than ""know it all"".,Depends on a few things.  Let's say (for whatever reason) that the algorithms you want to are not readily available in the programming language you want (for example, , but your company uses only Erlang).  This is a case where you might have to write a version yourself or write a an API to go from Erlang to Java. Which as you can imagine is a heavy duty software task and much less a ""data"" task.,The more common example is knowing which algo matches up to which situation and why as well as (very importantly) knowing why / where it would break down.,Thanks a lot for the input! The only thing I am still confused about is what are the things that I , do. You are suggesting to choose what to learn/practice next based on what I want to do later, but all I know is I wanna work in the field (not research mind you), which is not very specific in choosing what to learn next.,glad it helped.  So what can you do. Start small and figure out what interests you. Specifically:,Pairwise Comparison of Data Science Jobs,Having to think of all of the possible choices in a global data set of data science jobs is nearly impossible and will lead to analysis paralysis.,A much better way to figure out what you like or want is to do a pairwise comparison of possible data science jobs.,This is a list of job websites where you can search for ""data science"", ""data scientist"", etc:,
,
,
,
,For each of the five websites you can open the link, the ""data scientist"" in the search box and get a long list of data science positions.,The Actual Pairwise Comparison Process,For each website, the search will return a list of data science jobs. ,Note that each list at the bottom will have a ""next page"" navigation - ignore that for now.,What we will do is to open each possible job in a new tab.,Then the hard work begins!,Starting from the left most, going towards the right most, you'll do a pairwise comparison.,Here are the steps:,1) Look the first job you opened up in a tab - read the description and imagine yourself working at that company.,2) Switch to the tab 1 to the right of the one you opened up - read the description and imagine yourself working at that company.,3) Then JUST WITH THOSE TWO JOBS IN MIND, choose which one you would rather do.,4) Then close the tab that lost.,5) You now have a job that won,6) Re-read the job that won.,7) Go back to step #2,8) repeat until you have 1 winner for that specific website and that first job listing page,Winner Winner Chicken Dinner,At the end of this somewhat lengthy process, you will have picked 1 winner for each of the 5 job listing websites.,You will then have 5 different jobs that you found very interesting.,With those 5 jobs, write down any similarities between what you found - be it tools, location, data sets, industry, what you'll be doing, etc.,Through doing this process, you will have started figuring out what you want from a data science job.,Wow, that is a really detailed answer. It sounds like a really good idea! Thanks a lot for your help!,of course.  Good luck and do keep us up to date with what you find.  Lots of incredibly talented (and connected) people here in this sub who can help.  You just need to ask...  Take care!,I just graduated and am starting in a data science position shortly. However my math skills are lacking and I would like to enroll in a online masters program preferably within a year. I have been looking at CS, DS, and stats online masters programs and am unsure what route to take. The Georgia tech cs masters looks like a good option especially considering the price. I was thinking about taking classes at a community college for a year (Calc 1-3, linear algebra) and then applying to that after but am looking for opinions or other options about the best route to take.,Best bet would be to ask your (future) employer. Given they've already hired you, they should have a good read of where you are in terms of skills, where you'll fit into the team, and how you can grow into the team.,Without knowing your background, it's hard to say where you'd benefit the most from CS, DS, or stats.,One approach would be to round out your skills set.  Whereas the opposite approach would be to develop a greater expertise in what you're already good at.,Per the first part of the answer, you take into account what your employer would prefer as well as what you think your future jobs would prefer.  Some places prefer generalists whereas other places hire only for very specific roles.,Lastly, it's great that you're thinking about it now as it lets you plan.  But don't forget that once you start the job there will be lots of learning opportunities while you do the work so your education needs could change by the time you would be starting the program a year or two from now.,What do data science jobs look like in the wild?,We've got data scientists at my company, but they aren't doing anything sexy.  There isn't a case, I'm imagining, where there would be a convolutional neural network needed, for example.  ,So what are the ranges in job duties?  What are the data scientists at JP Morgan doing vs. the guys at Burger King and Google? ,Some people seem to think taking terrible data cleaning it and ""learning something new"" is data science.  Which i'll agree with, but it doesn't sound like it requires regression, or autoencoders, or any of the stuff that I would describe as sexy or interesting.  In building my path I'd be interested in the cool stuff, I'm not interested in just landing a job as a data scientist because they make bank.,I am currently in a graduate program studying machine learning but my undergrad was in a completely different field, but still very quantitative. I have heard mixed responses as to whether one should study subjects like real analysis and stochastic processes to enhance one's understanding of algorithms and techniques in data science/machine learning. Some say it is too theoretical to be of use and others say it is vital. I am one of those students that likes learning things from the ground up and doesn't like just using a pre-packaged API without knowledge of how it works. How useful are these subjects in data science (both from an understanding and application perspective)?,Real analysis no, stochastic processes yes.,I use what I learned in stochastic processes all the time, not explicitly, but I've always found stats a little harder to wrap my head around than anything else, and that course helped me get that ground up understanding. I also really liked real analysis, but have never used it in a practical way thus far.,Real analysis isnt particularly useful outside of being the basis of other useful areas like topology.,I am traditionally an embedded developer, lots of low-level work on microprocessors and fiddling with sensors. So I've worked with sensor data, occasional cleaning and basic statistical learning techniques. I want to transition to Data Science cos I think it gives me great flexibility in terms of the job market. How do you think a master's degree in Computational Science & Engineering will help me become a data scientist? CSE is traditionally more about mathematical modelling, parallel algorithms, data viz and numerical methods so it fits better with engineering background. Will it be unnecessary to spend so much time doing applied math than doing databases, statistics etc? What if I augment my syllabus with pertinent electives (databases, stats)? ,Honestly dont see why you would need parallel algos since it is very likely you wont be in the running for positions were that mattered. Those positions are saturated by PhDs,I am a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering with a few years experience looking to transition into Data Science in Silicon Valley (I live there now). I have a pretty strong background in statistics, and I know Python, am familiar with R, AWS, and MySQL.,What are next steps that are recommended for someone like me to continue the transition? What kinds of positions can I expect to be considered for?,You seem to have a pretty solid base. I would try to get some machine learning experience. After that, you're probably in a decent enough position to start looking for data scientist jobs. Ideally you'll want to have some code samples or data science projects under your belt so you can show them off.,Yeah machine learning is my next step =) I am also focusing on learning programming more in-depth, as I feel that being able to design efficient algorithms can have a lot of applications for large data sets (big O notation matters if you need to pre- or post-process anything... I would think). Are those skills valued in data science?,I was looking at Kaggle competitions for developing a portfolio. That's the best resource I have come across.,I think most skills will be valued as a data scientist. Beyond that it will depend on the specific role and environment. Some might value deeper statistical knowledge, some might want better programmers, etc... Also keep in mind that being able to clearly and concisely communicate your ideas is also an excellent tool to have. ,Hi everyone, I'm currently an Actuarial Analyst in the Health Insurance field, with a few of the Exams and courses completed. About 1.5 years into it now, and I've decided that it's not quite for me in the long run, so I've started to look at similar fields that would be as intriguing to me. To be honest, I just went for this position right away because I was one of those college graduates that still didn't know where they wanted to with their degree, and the pay is great for a starting job.,That being said, my choices now are to either switch into the P&C side of insurance, which is supposed to be more mathematical and analytical (and more appealing to me), or stick it out long enough and go pursue an MBA (which I'm a bit disheartened to do due to my poor undergrad GPA).,However, after doing some research online, I've strongly been considering a career as a data scientist. It seems to have the logical and analytical side of my current position, which I enjoy, and there are opportunities to be creative (something I'm currently lacking). That being said, my question is, where the hell am I supposed to get started? I know there are a lot of options (MS in Stats, Bootcamp, etc.) and I'm not looking for someone to tell me the best or easiest way to go about it.,Is there a way for me to apply to be a data scientist or some type of precursor role with my current experience? Is there a significant difference between online or in person bootcamps? Are they viewed differently? Any other advice would be helpful.
Finally my personal experience...B.S. in Mathematics (emphasis in Computational and Applied Math), < 3.0 GPA, minors in Statistics and Economics, and experience (with varying degrees of skill) in SQL, VBA, Excel, Access, Python, Matlab (if that's even relevant?).
Thanks,Hello everyone, looking at places where I can work on a remote master's degree in data science. My two picks that I would love to attend are Northwestern's MSPA program and Carnegie Mellon's MSIT BIDA program. I've heard good things from coworkers who are either working on/have worked on those degrees. Other programs I'm applying too are SMU's program and TAMU's program. Is there any other ones I should give consideration? Any thoughts on my current choices?,I'm a relatively recent graduate with a Master's in Econometrics, though the majority of my classes were in a Data Analytics specialization where I learned base SAS and applied statistics.  My undergrad (dual degree program) is in Mathematics, Finance, and Statistics, with coursework in SQL and R in addition to a bunch of statistical programs and Excel. My grades were very good, but I didn't have any internships.,After interviewing for positions nationwide for two years (long story; my perceived age and interview skills seemed to be the biggest hurdles ), I was hired as an analyst for a small company to write SQL queries, create Excel reports, and other finance and accounting tasks. I've been there a year and enjoy my job, but want to see how I can move into more of a data science role. Companies in my area (West Coast tech hub) seem to want more of a programming background, so I'm starting to learn Ruby and Python.,I would appreciate suggestions as to how I can further my career as a Data Scientist.  I've definitely improved my interview skills over time, but am still having a hard time convincing companies to look at my resume and see that I'm Data Scientist material. ,Hi everyone. I recently got accepted into University of Washington's Data Science masters. I am most likely going to accept their offer, but I would love it if one of the more experienced guys on here could look at their curriculum and give their 2 cents on it. ,Think its worth 45k plus the opportunity cost of leaving my job? Thanks.,Solid curriculum. Covers all the bases. Capstone project will be great for interviewing. ,Not sure if it's worth the cost, since I don't know how much you make per year. Do you know the placement stats of their past cohorts? Is 45k just tuition? Have you factored in housing, food, or other living expenses?,What types of personal projects would be impressive to a hiring manager for a data science role? After completing a certificate from Udacity or Coursera, what should you work on as a way to maintain and expand skills that can also be a portfolio item?,[deleted],I am guessing by the lack of any call backs you are a bachelors degree grad applying to data scientist positions with no networking introductions.,[deleted],Apply to data analyst positions.,What did you mean by networking introductions?,Someone in your social network who knows someone with decision making power in the job you are applying to (second order nepotism),Any Springboard alumni out there? I'm planning on doing a part-time DS bootcamp (since I'm working) to prepare for applying to entry-level Data Scientist roles and I feel like the best one I've seen so far is Springboard. Wanted to get some feedback on the mentorship and the curriculum. Also, how well did it prepare you for Data Scientist interviews?,I'm also interested to see feedback from Springboard alumni. There are some reviews on ,. The two ones about data science seem as though it was a great overview, but not necessarily a career changer.,Do you already have a strong academic background / work experience? If you are looking at their intensive course offering, 100 hours is definitely not enough to get a solid understanding of data science. The in-person bootcamps (as well as coding bootcamps) that have been mentioned on this subreddit usually require 400 hours of class time, assignments and projects, and some of those graduates don't end up finding jobs. The top bucket of students will clock in 600-750 hours over the course of the program. Class everyday + nights + weekends.,The statement on Springboard's site: ""Apply for most entry-level Data Scientist jobs (with a portfolio to show)"", is disingenuous and leading. No bootcamp should guarantee job outcomes. Or even college or graduate school for that matter.,I have a B.A. in Statistics but haven't been using any coursework since graduation so I feel like I forgot everything... I am proficient in SQL and Python so I definitely have a decent foundation for more intensive DS studying. I'm definitely planning on building a stronger self-study lifestyle and put in the hours to prepare for entry-level DS jobs so I think Springboard is a decent start.,It's just that even all these part-time, online programs are serious $ commitments so I wanted to get better feedback on Springboard,I am an undergraduate psychology student, and discovered a love of statistics and data analysis.  I am doing my honours thesis with the quantitative lab (on Bayesian analysis), and I already have pretty decent skills in R.  ,What sort of Masters degree would best allow me to A) get some sort of job doing analysis and B) provide me with skills that I can build towards a career as a data scientist?  Current options I am looking at include a Masters in Data Science, Statistics, Business Analytics, Quantitative Psychology and an MSc in ""Applied Modelling and Quantitative Methods"".   I know that I likely will not be able to get a job as a ""data scientist"" as soon as I graduate, but I am hoping to get a related job and then build on my skills in my spare time.  Thank you.  ,I've recently made the transition from a masters-level data analyst position in a semi-academic capacity at a hospital to a similar position in a business intelligence department at a for-profit healthcare provider. The managers here are keenly interested in my predictive analytics skills, and I want to make sure said skills are up to snuff for this new setting. I know this is a fairly narrow request, but does anyone know of any recommendations for training programs or education materials for people with a background in modeling and analytics transitioning into a business setting?,Taking MIT course called analytics edge. So far so good. Im planning on taking andrew ngs course as well. Transitioning to a new field is difficult for me. I want to break out from unemployment.,Do you guys have any idea how i can approach companies and increase my job prospects without going for a masters/degree? I would like to work on practical projects to improve my skills and gain work experience. i cant afford studying for years just to prepare myself for the role. Time is not on my side.,Data science is a broad field. Does one need a high threshold of understanding/experience to get a job? My background is in economics and i have good understanding of statistics. Strangely, my university never taught me any software to use. All my knowledge is theoretical ,Hello All, I have a PhD in Chemical Engineering and I'm looking to transition into DS. I have a computational background, but not a lot of coding skills. I know Machine Learning basics and I'm comfortable using R. I just started learning python. I have zero knowledge about SQL and other db management systems. I have completed 2 personal projects in analyzing data and a few Kaggle competitions. ,Questions:
* Should I look for an internship to get industry experience?  Most internship opportunities are for people who are still in program, and I graduated some time ago. 
* Is it a good idea to tap into my network for internship opportunities? 
* What are some other ways to get my foot in the door?,Btw, I'm based in Chicago.,I would apply to internships and jobs. Figure out what your call back rate is and where you are stumbling in the process.,I'm a Communication and Multimediadesign student from the Netherlands who's rounding up his bachelors with an internship at a creative digital agency. So, I'm coming from a bit of a strange direction, having studied design the last four years. Now, I'm not exactly sure what everything is called in english, but before my final internship I followed a so called 'Minor' (a half year course). My minor was about Dataviz, and that's what got me interested. This minor mainly focussed on the graphic part of the data, but I was more interested in the analysis part. ,My final internship was at a creative digital agency, with some pretty big clients. My job was to visualize, analyze and provide insights in the dataset of a pretty big chain of hotels.,To do so, I started out in excel but quickly dropped it in favor of R, which I then taught myself. I found R pretty easy to pick up, except that the syntax was a bit strange sometimes (coming from Javascript). So with R I cleaned up the data, and started adding variables of my own. For example there were columns about the number of adults, children and babies and I turned these into shortcodes (1A1C0B, for example) so I could visualize these.  So that's the kind of stuff I did, just simple statistics, calculating averages or sums and visualizing these in simple charts using R. Now, this stuff actually brought some interesting insights and the internship company would really like to keep me, and educate me further so they can keep me on as a Data Scientist/Analyst.,My problem is; I'm unsure on what fields I should further educate myself. I really like digging through data, building scripts and creating insights. Motivation isn't the problem either. I just don't know where to go from here.,I think I need a lot more math and statistic knowledge, but I could also benefit greatly from enlarging my programming knowledge. I think I already have a decent sense on what marketable insights are, and where businesses could find interesting oppertunities. ,So what I'm looking for is some advice on where to go now. Currently I'm eyeballing this study:
,
I'd love to hear your opinions about this study, and any other options I could look at.,Hi all,,If anyone is interested in doing an Introduction to Probability course with me, check out my post ,.,Cheers!"
", I apologize in advance for another career advice question but this is a great community and I was hoping to get some insight. I'm trying to transition to a career in data science or something closely resembling it and I'm debating the merits of going back to school to help fill up the gaps in my skills/education.,A little context, I currently have a master's degree in economics and work for a company building and implementing economic models. In both my education and current job I have a lot of experience with econometric techniques and working with data more generally. In undergad/grad school I used STATA and for the past year or so I have been learning R through coursera, datacamp, textbooks,  youtube videos and some personal projects. ,I have learned a ton over the last year but I still feel like I am very far away from being competitive for a datascience job opening. I currently don't have any real experience working with SQL, but other than that I think I have the appropriate skill set to work as a data analyst at some level. ,With my econ background I am relatively comfortable with statistics and many of the machine learning concepts but what I truly lack is skills/knowledge/experience relating to computer science. Outside of R, and some really entry level python tutorials/videos, I don't have any programming experience or skills. I am currently mulling over options regarding going back to school and I was hoping to get some input from ,. ,I am very intrigued by some of the master programs specifically for data science, like Cal Berekely's and the University of Washington's program. I know that these types of programs are newer and there isn't a strong consensus on how their graduates do in industry. I have also thought about doing a bootcamp program but again don't know if it would be optimal given my current skill set. My third option would be doing some sort of post-bac or certificate program solely in computer science to help with my biggest weakness. ,Other factors at play, I have strong grades/test scores/work experience/references so I do think I would be competitive for some of the MS Data Science programs. I also don't have any existing student loans or debt, so while it is still a sizable investment I have some financial flexibility in going back to school. I also really love school and learning, and it has been frustrating trying to self-teach myself so much while still working full time. ,Has anyone here successfully transitioned from a traditional economics background to a datascience career? My end goal is to work at the intersection of politics/public policy and datascience. Either working for the government to harness data for better policy design and outcomes, or to work in political consulting on the analytics side. Any thoughts, advice, or tips would be greatly appreciated., Have MA Economics and work in economic modeling but looking to make the transition to a career in datascience. Thoughts on marginal benefit for an additional masters degree in data science or data science bootcamp for someone with solid stats/analysis background but very weak programming/production/CS?,PhD Economics here so take this with a handful of salt. My  Official title is ""operations research principal"" but it's all the same.  Having interviewed a number of Master data science/analytics grads I would say don't bother.  Admittedly, this is based on a fairly small sample but I don't believe these programs provide much value as their curriculum is far too broad to give students a good grasp of either the statistical or programming concepts. If your statistics are solid I would say you are already in a better position than most.  (My biased opinion is that economics tends to be a good background for the field as people are accustomed to applying data to messy real world problems to attempt to answer questions. Just get past being a regression monkey! ;) )  The people I disliked the least that were from these programs had interesting professional backgrounds prior to doing the Masters. Most of the candidates (from a range of schools, some fairly well known) résumés that harped on their educational/project experience read like the top 10 google results for data science tutorials, most of which is useless if you are to exceed in this type of role.  Leverage your current position to fill the voids you have...automate what you can, even if it's just to be able to say that you have... connect your models with SQL and track your work from data inputs all the way to output. Program some estimation routine into stata/R/python to show a grasp.   In other words, make your work reproducible so that you can speak towards it in an interview.,I still firmly believe, and hire accordingly [and fairly successfully], that people good with statistics who can program, even just POCs, are far more valuable than the reverse. Implicit assumption being that you possess the ability to think your way through a problem that doesn't have a predetermined solution path.,I appreciate your reply, and hope you don't mind me asking a follow up question. One of the reasons why I am eager to explore going back to school/a bootcamp is that my company builds proprietary software with all of the data self contained. I really am at a loss for how to incorporate the production side of coding, automation, etc. into my existing workflow. As it currently stands I just use our software to do analysis and there isn't any need/use for automation or connecting to another data base. For presentations I will take the data out of our models and visualize using ggplot, but this is certainly far from where I'd like to be in terms of demonstrating tech skills in my current role. If I can't really leverage my existing role into an opportunity to develop and showcase these skills, would it make more sense to find another work opportunity in the ""economics"" world that does give me that opportunity and then use that as a bridge into a more traditional data science role?,Your followup question is exactly what I would recommend. If there's no opportunity to grow in current environment, leverage your background and experience into something that more straddles the line you are hoping to cross. ,Other than the topic of your data, what do you consider the difference between building economic models and ""datascience""?,Maybe I'm romanticising quantitive economics, but it sounds like datascience to me.,The company I work for essentially builds one structural model of the economy and just populates it with different data for different geographical areas. I then work with the model to do economic analysis but just using our own software. I might have been too vague with my description, in my day to day workflow I use economic models and explain how they are built, but I don't actually work on building new models. Our company already built the model and now it is essentially just automatically updated when new data is released by BEA, BLS, etc. ,Having a more datascience-focused role to me would involve gathering data, cleaning it, formulating a model structure, train/test, and then communicate the results. Right now I basically am just using the software we have created to skip to the communication part. So my actual job is using the software and explaining how the model works and I am looking to add some more fun to my job by having a greater diversity of problems/applications I tackle. ,Thank you for the in-depth explanation.,I am convinced that you mostly have the skills needed to build models and clean data, and the main benefit of a Masters in Data Science would be a bit of reframing skills and some expansion, but mostly networking and branding."

"Get in contact with their alumni network and start asking how the program helped them and if it was worth it. ,The two things I've seen these programs offer are 1) a set of practical trainings to help you demo your skills to potential employers (basic stuff like how to build an interactive web page or deploy an application to heroku just) and 2) a prebuilt network of potential employers (a match making service). ,Get the curriculum from and similar program and you can do the first half by yourself. Start attending local data science and big data events (check meetup.com in your area) and you can do the second half yourself.  ,My coding skills are a little rusty, as the analysis of my data was pretty straight forward. I mainly used python, but the programs were sort of cobbled together with pieces added as time went on, so I would feel pretty embarrassed showing a potential employer this stuff.,What about taking a certificate course from a university? Is this looked upon more favorably than one of these bootcamps? ,From what I've seen, no one care about these programs. I actually mistrust them somewhat because candidates from these programs might be more polish than substance. ,What I normally look for is 1) raw capability (probably not a problem for you with a Ph.D.) and 2) a propensity to build useful things for other people, preferably using data. These programs, and university certifications don't really help on either of these dimensions. The programs at least do help with networking. ,In brief, build awesome stuff and go network. ,Great! Thanks for the advice. It's reassuring to know that I can take a lot of the required learning into my own hands. If there's one thing a Ph.D. has taught me, it's how to be a self-guided learner. Thanks again.,The networking is what's really worth it. Everything else you could learn on your own.,Thanks for the help! I'll give meetups a shot right now and I'll try to get in contact with program alumni to get their opinion. Finding work is tougher than I thought! ,Where are you graduating from and where do you want to live and work?,I took the Data Science Dojo bootcamp in January. It was worth my time because I got a job at Data Science Dojo (so I'm not a completely unbiased party). The company does get feedback at the end of each bootcamp. We've posted what people say (good and bad) in wordclouds on our blog - ,

"I'll try to be brief as possible. Graduated in 2014 with a master in mechanical engineering and working for a small construction firm. I am no longer happy with my job and my career is no longer fulfilling. ,For past few days, I've been struggling on whether to go back to grad school for a master in computer science or take online courses like General Assembly or Data Science bootcamp. I have little programming skills with C and Matlab which I enjoy doing back in school. Now I'm doing a free online course in python programming in Code Academy. Now looking into coursera to expand my knowledge. My questions follows:,How employers view on someone that has 2 master degree? ,Anyone have experience with General Assembly or something similar? How about Data Science bootcamp?,Any other advise are welcome.,They don't care how many degrees you have, the skills and experience you have matters. You can start from Coursera's data science certificate from John Hopkins and ML from Andrew Ng,This is the tip of the iceburg however. You will almost certainly have to supplement this with a decent github portfolio of serious projects,Not really. The people I've hired so far have 0 repositories on Github. They passed the tech tasks brilliantly though.,I find this really surprising. As an employer, how often do you see applicants with/without decent repositories?,There are applicants for software development/engineering that have great Github repos. They are often passionate young devs that try a lot of things. I find that quite good to be honest and as far as I know they do very well in their test tasks. Keep in mind I only support and observe these applications, I'm not the hiring manager for these positions.,For data science related positions (analysts, scientists and engineers) I saw one good Github repo and it was from a data engineering applicant. There were a couple more but irrelevant or lacking quality. I've assessed 50+ people in the last year.,I see Github repos the same way I see MOOCs. It's nice to see people have gone the extra mile to learn and try new things but in the end what matters is the interviews and the test tasks. Those are the ones that will tell me if they fit, if they can grow and if they'll be happy. Anyone can have a huge Github account with machine learning stuff back and forth but not that many people test heteroscedasticity or know what regularisation is.,Don't get me wrong, I have a personal and a professional git and I love MOOCs! But those will not have an impact on my hiring decisions.,Wow, I'm still quite surprised. Thanks so much for the insight, great response!,Cool, thanks :),Do you have any thoughts about General Assembly or those bootcamps?,I'm currently in a data science bootcamp (zipfian/galvanize) and am happy to answer questions."
"Side note: my ideal career would be in data visualization, as I'm very visual and artistically inclined. But I'm having an even harder time figuring out a route into this! Maybe if I did the MSc in Data Science and worked on visualization projects in my spare time? Any thoughts?,Mathematical Modelling is a great stepping stone to a career in data science, but a targeted MSc would be even better.,If you are interested in a data visualization engineer role, there is a lot you need to explore outside the traditional data science curriculum. Get some books on visual information and design theory. Learn popular tools like D3.js and Tableau. When doing projects in your MSc, go over-the-top with the visualizations, as in spend 20-40% of the entire project on making beautiful, interactive visuals. ,Thanks for the input. I'm asking because everyone seems to suggest that Masters in Data Science are worthless on this subreddit. ,As somebody on an MSc data science, do it. You can become a data scientist without one. But career hunting is about more than job title. If you want to work in anything quantitative in say finance, you have no hope without an msc. Same is true about a lot of large companies in tech. Subscribe to a site like monster and see how many adds want people with an Msc (hint, it's a lot, especially the better paid or more interesting roles). ,Even if you end up in a role that doesn't need one, you will be better qualified and that helps. ,Read the kaggle blog about the woman who got a job at Winton capital as a result their kaggle competition. She had a post-doc in statistics and she didn't make it sound like it was a slam dunk landing the role. If there are kaggle masters with post doc education in a relevant area who don't just walk into roles, don't listen to some guy on the internet telling you how formal education isnt worth it. ,You can certainly learn enough aeronautics from the internet to be at a good enough level to land a job designing aircraft. Doesn't mean you shouldnt go do a PhD if this what you want to do. ,Complex Systems Modelling is great if you can get work in it. Data Science is good if you want a comfortable income. I did Computational Neuroscience, and it was an awesome fun way to end up in poverty. Now I'm trying to get into Data Science so I can eat.,Thanks everyone, made the switch! Your comments helped :),Do this MSc in Data Science and worked on visualization projects.
Why you ask.  People at least know what data science is.  "
"I can say that the placement rate for General Assembly is pretty good (if you are agnostic on title, meaning analyst, scientist, engineer ect). It's somewhere around 75% at the 6 month mark. However, recently they have changed their teaching model, and I think its significantly worse, so I think their placement rate will suffer. ,Dont they take and recruit a lot from engineers which would make a title agnostic placement stats deceptive if including engineer?,I have not been impressed by their instructors as they grow.,I can't say much about the placement rate for bootcamps, but from the description of your experience, it sounds like you should be getting bites on your job applications, so I would investigate other reasons the job search is not going well (i.e. are your resume and cover letter good?).,Might want to give them a review, that's good feedback. My main limiting factor is the market. I'm in a small job market, not a lot of opportunity. Seeing lots of opportunities in California, Denver, and Seattle, only a few jobs a month where I'm at.,Do you mean do they have a lot of engineers in their class ? Some... but none of them are Data engineers "
"depends on what you want to do?  Python is easy to use and learn, but for speed C is the way to go.,Learn Python, a lot of packages are written in C under the hood and the efficiency is plenty for most bioinformatics work. Unless you're developing software tools you'll benefit most from Python.,I picked up python pretty quickly, since I learned Java in school, but I'm currently solving bioinfo problems with Java, because my upper level CS courses at my school use Java and I've been away from Java for some time,Do you have any recommendations on the best way to learn C on your own?  I program mostly in Perl and R, so I'd really love to become better in some of the other widely used bioinformatics languages such as Python and C.,K&R to start. After that read something in Modern C. ,Unless you are writing challenging algorithms that need the speedup C gives you will almost never need it.,I think I've needed to code in C once in my career because I wanted to make a very small C application accept a stream.  I learned it in university in the compsci 101 class and if I hadn't known it I probably could have re-implemented the algorithm in python as it didn't need the speed that much had I not decided it would be neat to learn how to do it in C in that case.,I would learn python and perhaps some of the speedup tools for it like numba for the rare occasions when you need the speed well before I would recommend learning C.,Basically it is an time/effort trade off.  Unless you know C really well you are unlikely to be able to use it for anything meaningful and the odds that you have a use case that would make it meaningful are slim.,Yes Cython!,I also do most stats with in R but Python is my primary language to do general bioinfo work. ,Python is now the main language of bioinformatics, so if one was to only learn one language that should be the one they focus on. When it comes to pure stats and figures some people prefer R, so I would rank that as second in the language list - though depending on the specific work of an individual, R may get used more than Python.,Aren't bootcamp courses typically to learn a topic, rather than practice it (which is what you sound like you want to do)? Perhaps I'm not fully understanding your situation. Can you clarify what specific topics you've learned and what exactly you hope to gain?,If you already know Python syntax and algorithmic logic and you simply want to practice your coding abilities, I think solving problems on , would be more appropriate than some bootcamp course,If you're just trying to improve your skills with specific popular Python modules like numpy, pandas, or scipy, however, then I agree that some bootcamp of some sort would be appropriate,I essentially would like to better the minor skills I gathered in the bioinfo classes I took for my program. I know how to use some things within python but would like to learn enough to handle big data or design my own python programs to handle NGS information. ,You could try ,Hi, this is a workshop not a bootcamp but maybe you'll like this:,It's a 2 hour workshop for biologists / beginner bioinformaticians on loading nextgen file formats in Python and starting on some graphs."
"Thread will stay alive until next one so keep posting after the date in the title.,Thanks to everyone for answering questions!,Type of Questions that fit here:,Link to Wiki that contains Questions & Answers from previous weeks:,Anyone from the subreddit have a success story where they were in analytics and transitioned to data science? I am a manager for an audit analytics shop at a big bank. Our work primarily consists of reporting analysis.  While we have fancy tools, most of our work is a date range filter with a few fields filtered and then sort the results. If the auditors got trained on how to get their own data we would be out of a job. Not exciting. I would like to transition to a more predictive analysis/quantitative analysis, but I do not have the stats background.,I am still paying off the master's in accounting that I do not currently use. I would like to see if they are any stories of people using online learning/resources that are free/cheap (not $50k grad degree) and are now data scientists.  I use SAS and SQL and I am learning R (Udemy).  Also signed up for Python courses (Udemy) but have not had the chance to take them yet. I am also on the lookout for Math/Stats courses that are recognized by employers and affordable.,Any success stories you could share would be greatly appreciated.,I got an undergraduate degree in statistics and worked in analytics for 2 years. I just recently attained a data science position about 1 month ago.  ,Most of the work I did in the analytics position was reporting and ETL work. By a stroke of good fortune, I was able to get on one predictive analytics project which helped immensely when I was interviewing for data science positions. ,It seems employers want some kind of hard evidence that candidates can do a data science project end to end.  I strongly recommend trying to find an application of predictive modeling in your current role or start to do side projects that demonstrate you can define a problem, collect/manipulate data, perform analysis, and summarize the results.  I had some side projects on my resume that didn't even come up in my interviews, though. A project that has a dollar value attached to it will have a bit more weight. ,I taught myself all my machine learning knowledge from online resources and podcasts. Some of my favorite resources below:,Online: machinelearningmastery.com, Andrew Ngs  Coursera class, ,Books: The Elements of statistical learning (assuming you have taken linear algebra),Podcasts: partially derivative, linear digressions,My goal was to just completely immerse myself in data science blogs, books, YouTube videos, etc for a long period of time. Eventually stuff that made no sense to me just started to click when I saw it enough times. ,One last bit-  I would recommend learning either python OR R really well before you start to dabble in both. Focus your effort on a specific language and when you establish more expertise delve into an additional language. ,I'm happy to discuss more if you need help. ,I find many parallels between your experience and mine. I'm a year out of my undergrad degree in statistics working as a data scientist (but functionally more of a data engineer right now) and I'm trying to figure out how to get on more data science related projects. ,How did you deal with the expectation that most data scientists have a PhD or masters? How were you able to sell your self taught experiences? I'm currently competing at my current company with a bunch of PhD and masters students for the real data science work. I'd appreciate any perspective or thoughts you might have,Fortunately, the co-workers I work with are both data scientist with bachelors degrees.  They are extremely well read and have decades of stats/data science experience.  I pretty much was just fortunate enough to land a job in a company and work with people who don't put much weight to the letters behind the name. ,In my previous job, I was fortunately able to get on a predictive analytics project where I was able to use a few machine learning methodologies.  I sold that project big time and they seemed intrigued.  From my experience, companies want evidence that you can do a data science project end-to-end. That is from defining a problem, finding/managing your own data, analyzing it, and implementing your results.  I suspect work done on the job that has a dollar value attached to it will hold slightly more weight than personal projects; however, personal projects are definitely a medium to demonstrate some work as well.  Kaggle competitions can be good for the modeling component; however, they aren't truly ""end-to-end"" in the sense that the problem is already defined, data already collected, and the evaluation metric is give to you. ,I ran into this BIG TIME at my first job.  If you didn't have an advanced degree you were lucky to get work outside of data visualization and dashboard/report building.  I basically kept expressing to my boss the type of work I really wanted to get some experience in and I was fortunate to get eventually get a shot.  I'd say the easiest-though still challenging- way to get on a Data Science project is to find a problem your company is facing and make a proposition on how it can be solved via a model. My bosses were never the most technically inclined people, and didn't really know the capabilities of Data Science.  Them not getting me a lot of data science work was not due to them not trying; rather, they simply didn't have the technical acumen to identify and define problems to be solved. ,Even if you end up not being able to get on a lot of the data science work, it may be worth asking the PhDs if they would sit down with you and step you through their work.  I'm sure there is much to learn from them, and you may spot a couple of areas where you can contribute in some form. ,I hope that is what you are looking for, and I'm happy to answer any more questions!,Sorry for the delayed response, this was a fantastic reply and super helpful to get additional perspective!! ,Awesome insight.
I have one question, i know it is not related to your situation but if you can help out that would be great. I am trying to switch as an analyst to data science but all i have are side projects. My company doesn't deal with data modeling. How should i go on about a project that stands out and get me a job. ,What are your interests?  I'd say finding a project that you are genuinely interested in is really helpful.  Ideally, the project would become something you , to do instead of something you , to do to get a job.  ,When I was trying to do side projects, I initially tried just finding random datasets and doing stuff with them, but I found a lot of the stuff I was working with really boring.  One project I did was to try to make a recommendation engine for movies (found a user rating dataset online). I wasn't invested or engaged in it, though, because it wasn't something I was that interested in.  I was just doing the project to do the project.  Once I started working on something I really enjoy, Baseball, I as able to have a lot of fun, ask meaningful questions, and get something completed.  ,In terms of what types of projects, something that is end to end is ideal.  Companies want to hire people who can take a project end to end.  ,I can make project recommendations, but, again, I highly recommend it is something you are interested in.  A couple of the ones i did were (1) making a recommender engine for movies and (2) predict which major league baseball players would enter into the hall of fame based on their career.  ,A great way to find a project is to (1) think of a question you want answered and (2) try to find data that can help you answer that question.  Let your questions guide what data you need, don't let a specific dataset limit what you want to answer. ,Once you have some projects complete, something that I've seen a lot of people do is start a blog and do write-ups on their projects and/or have summary applications on a website (if applicable).  You can showcase a lot of different skills here as well.  A part of data science (depending on where, maybe) is being able to hack together quick applications to deploy a model or the results of research.  If you could create some report/summary/webpage showcasing results that would be cool as well. ,I'm happy to discuss more if you ever need to bounce ideas off someone, need help with a project, or have questions about DS.  Just let me know. ,I got a degree in statistics, and to be honest, the only tools I learned how to use during college were SAS and Minitab. And I had one class that basically taught me how to write ""Hello World"" programs in C++. Everything else I learned on the job from Googling things on Stackoverflow or w3schools or similar (I was an undergrad researcher in the lab I am now an analyst at). I found the best way was to find a problem to solve and just start digging in with R/Python/MySQL to try and solve it. ,Take it with a grain of salt I guess because my employers weren't all that obsessed with every little class I've take since they already knew my work. I'm also very young and inexperienced, but I do have a good job that I like. Both kinds of employers exist, but I guess you just have to find someone that cares more about what you know than what you look like on paper if you aren't willing to do a grad degree. ,That sounds true for most programming related issues, but do you feel the statistics portion helped ferment an understanding of the math required for DS work? ,Well I am an analyst not a programmer so most of my work involves running statistical tests, not creating software where you need more of a theoretical background. I will say that I work in bioinformatics and coming from any kind of math/programming helps tremendously as most people are coming from biological and have a limited knowledge of mathematical concepts. ,I wouldn't necessarily agree. My experience may be a little different, I did a lot of R and got really good SQL exposure as a statistics undergrad. I originally was a math major and switched to stats and fell in love with comp stats. I work as a data analyst at a sizable tech startup, I do some predictive modeling and ad-hoc statistical analysis so my work is a little more on the ds side. My stats background helped immensely; I spend a lot of time reasoning through a problem and having to back up my assumptions / theory. I know doing proofs about MLEs in math-stats isn't fun but that built-intuition helped, you just make sure to do comp stats stuff (R, Python, Machine Learning, SQL) as an undergrad to set yourself apart.,This is true of many stat departments, which is one of the main reasons that ""data science"" is a thing.  If statistics departments actually taught programming and data analysis instead of how to plug your numbers into other peoples' code, we'd just have modernized statistics.,I'll second that you should definitely learn R (or Python) and SQL on your own, as SAS really limits you to more ""boring"" jobs.  More importantly, learn how to use packages to make your life easier.,There have been some anecdotal accounts published here and on Quora. Not entirely sure what the backgrounds were, but if I recall they were from computer science, engineering and/or analytics.,From what I gathered, it took those individual 1-3 years of self-studying (while holding down a job or academic studies) to be confident enough and apply for jobs with the ""Data Scientist"" title. In most of those cases, they also found internships or fellowships with some professor or small startup.,Have you thought about a data science bootcamp? They are about $10-16k, depending on which one. It's a big risk, but I'm bullish on the sector and foresee technical bootcamps replacing a lot of technical MS degrees in the future.,I'm very skeptical about the quality of these, considering there's an incentive for graduates to say they're really good so that the $10-16K actually goes towards career advancement.  For example, ,.,Additionally, last year, ten boot camps promised to allow for independent, third-party verification of their job placement rates.  ,.,Once you get familiar with R or python, I would highly recommend checking out kaggle.com.  Even if you don't know either language yet, still check it out.    ,After asking myself the same questions for over two years I decided to go for it. Next Monday I will start a Master in Data Science at the University of Barcelona. ,Big move for me and my family to move to another continent to pursue a dream, wish me luck!,Does anyone know a bit about Insight & Analytics roles at a big 4 like PWC or a management consultancy? I'm mostly interested in how this would differ from a ""Data Scientist"" role in industry, in terms of day-to-day work, learning, progression opps, exit opps, future salary? Thanks!,I don't know exactly, right now the company I'm with is in partnership with PWC and they seem to have a mostly consultative role. I.E. helping us build a road map vs doing actual analysis. ,I'm fairly sure Deloitte and PwC have data scientist consultancies in some form. Check out their career sites. I would imagine it would entail a LOT of traveling. ,I have had a Bachelor's in Mathematics for 2 years and completed a certification from a data science bootcamp 2 months ago. I've been networking and throwing my resume into the void since finishing college and was hoping the bootcamp would improve my prospects.,I've received 2 interviews from an auto finance company before they stopped contacting me, and am sitting on a pre-screen with a video streaming service that I'm pretty sure I botched, but I'm still frustrated.,Ever since I finished college and tried entering the workforce, my biggest road block has been 'Required Years of Experience'. Even when I fill out all other qualifications like Machine Learning knowledge, Programming languages (Python, SQL, R, etc), even advanced knowledge of Excel and VBA, I get knocked out of the running because I don't have the experience they're looking for. I've had rejection emails say that explicitly. I hadn't been able to get a job with my Mathematics degree because of this, and because of that, I'm tripping up all over the place in my data science job search. The only reason I got those two prospects was because the video streaming service was an entry level analyst position (hardly data science at all), and a data scientist in the auto finance company offered me a chance when I asked him for advice on LinkedIn. Is there any way to get by this or should I just focus completely on LinkedIn., I don't have the years of experience that every job asks for but I'm fairly sure I'm qualified for at least SOMETHING regardless of long-term experience and it's really frustrating me as I search for a Data Science job. What should I do?,This is a little late, but I graduated with a Bachelor's in Applied Mathematics about two months ago and just recently found a job as an associate data scientist through Indeed. My only previous job experience was a short internship analyzing data in Excel, and half a semester of text analysis work in Python.,I think one of my bigger selling points were the personal projects I had on my resume.  I had one project where I analyzed a years worth of Reddit data, and another where I showed my work on one of the easier Kaggle projects.,My advice would be to apply for any job with a name similar to business/data analysis/analyst/scientist because a lot of companies have different names for what is essentially the same position. I applied to 200+ jobs and maybe had ~15 phone interviews which led to 5 second rounds, and one job offer. And to keep adding things to your portfolio to show that you can actually analyze data and it's something you're interested in.,Can you tell me which country are you residing in?,United States,You should share your experience in more detail here  : , 
A lot of others will probably benefit from it ,Do you have a link to your portfolio?,When hiring for entry-level positions, you hire for attitude. You want someone that has the skills but, most importantly, someone that is passionate about data analysis and data science. Where is that reflected in your application? Do you have a portfolio with some non-academic analysis projects?,I have one github project that extracts youtube video data and puts together a recommender system for similar channels. It's real basic and isn't something I really comfortable sharing outside of an application atmosphere, but it works.,What data science bootcamp did you go to?,Galvanize in Seattle. They also have cohorts in San Francisco and Denver.,Damn. So sorry to hear about your experience. I heard Galvanize has been expanding like crazy. I took a look at them 2 years ago when they were Zipfian. Back then, they had the most well thought out curriculum and great placement stats. Nowadays, it seems like the quality of instruction or support has just disappeared. I've read of other grads who are striking out.,What did you do before the bootcamp, after graduating?,Oh no I wouldn't blame them for my setbacks. I came in from a minimum wage part-time tutoring job with the salvation army since they were the only ones who would hire me. It's a real problem with the current job market that everyone wants someone with experience but no one wants to stick their neck out to give that experience. Like even entry level jobs in sales divisions even ask for 1-2 years previous work experience, so I don't blame Galvanize for that.,The bootcamp was actually quite thorough with the basics so it at least gave me enough skills that I could market myself as an analyst at least but I'm still gonna try to get into a science role later on. Speaking of, I didn't strike out, I actually got a job offer as a risk analyst for an auto finance company so I'm pretty set on taking that so I can get the aforementioned work experience that I don't have currently. Someone offered to foreward my resume to the data science team there after I connected with them on LinkedIn and asked for advice on how to break into the market.,Right, I wasn't pointing the finger at them. At least when they saw your background and interviewed you, did they tell you that you will probably only qualify for data analyst roles? Or were you under the impression that you would be competitive for data scientist roles?,That being said, there are easier, cheaper alternatives to getting an analyst role. Then, do something like Galvanize to get into the scientist role. Thanks for the background info.,Oh no, there were other students in there who have well paying scientist jobs right now. Of course, they came into the program with several years of previous experience and higher educations. Like, the first two hires were both PhD's.,Speaking of which, a lot of positions ask for levels of education that aren't necessary to do the job, like Masters or PhD because the word scientist is in the job title. If you really wanted to, a Masters is about all that you'd need to be able to apply to any given position but for the most part any position specifically requesting a PhD either doesn't know what Data Science is, is working with so much money that they're terrified of mistakes, or is working with data complex enough that the job could be considered academic in nature. Point being, I'm super bitter about companies asking for high level data scientists when they're really working with basic data and business modelling.,But to answer your question, I was looking at competitive data science roles, just my main roadblock was a Bachelor's in Mathematics that couldn't get me a job for a year and I was pigeon holed into that tutor job because, like I said, nobody wants to hire someone without experience unless you can find the backdoor into a job via volunteer work or networking.,I'm a software engineer and I'm interested in moving into more of a data science role. I'm heavily into SQL, I've worked with Hadoop, and I've developed a warehouse and ETL system from scratch. My current thought is to do some MOOC/Coursera learning and then try to push into that role at my current company. If my current company doesn't allow me into that role, then I'll look for other opportunities.,I'm wondering if there is value in doing a master's in data science, applied statistics, or something else. Does it make a big difference when applying for other jobs? Assuming that I can get into this role at my current company, does job experience outweigh a lack of grad degree? I'm also open to other suggestions including specific programs to look into.,Would you be interested in data engineering rather than just data science. The difference, in case you didn't know, is that the former is more focused on making data platforms scalable, robust and performant while the later is more about building data models and recommendations. In either case, have you considered programs, such as the Insight data engineering fellowship? (Full disclosure: I'm a program director for Insight's New York office). See below for more info:,Insight Fellows Programs for September deadlines are fast approaching!,Apply at: ,Deadline July 4: Data Engineering New York and Data Engineering Silicon Valley,That looks pretty awesome actually but I see the end goal is job placement, what if I already have a job? I think this is something they would pay for and allow me to be focused on this for 4-5 weeks.,Hi there, sorry for the late response. You are right that getting a job is the main purpose. We do run data labs that give you access to some of these tools over a two week course. Else if your company would pay for you to be focused on building a data pipelime for 4-5 weeks, there's nothing stopping you also suggesting they pay for access to something like AWS, creating a cluster and developing your own big data project. It's a bit tougher to do it on your own but if you tap into onlime resources and maybe try to get inspiration from meetups, it might get you what you are seeking.,Sounds like your already half-way towards be a data engineer. No need to quit your job and do a fellowship.,Data Engineer - Design, construct, install, test and maintain highly scalable data management systems (Hadoop, Spark, NoSQL),Data Scientist - Develop and plan required analytics projects in response to business needs (Python, Machine Learning, Visualizations),Which role are you more interested in? I have a program in mind if your leaning towards data science rather than data engineering.,Data science definitely, visualizations and interpretations are what I'm into.,I can send you some information about the online data science bootcamp I work for. It is part-time over 6 months, so you could complete it while keeping your current job. Let me know if that sounds like something you might be up for? I can send more details via PM.,I'd be interested, please PM me!,I've also been looking for data science bootcamps and what you've described seems something that could fit me.

Can you please PM me?,[deleted],How is this different from coursera or udacity besides the 12k you're charging.?,Posted my PM by mistake...so I removed it.,We have live streaming classes at night and regular TA support. We are equivalent to an in-person bootcamp like Metis, NYC Data Science Academy or Galvanize, not a MOOC provider.,Yes please I am also interested in that bootcamp, PM me, will be a great help.,Sure, no problem.,Hi all. So I have my PhD in nuclear/particle physics and am currently doing a Postdoc in the field. However, the further I get into this, the more I realize that academia just isn't for me... I just can't keep working in an environment where all your collaborators are actively trying to take away your livelihood by submitting better grant proposals combining your work with theirs, grant money is so scarce you HAVE to publish twice a year even if you don't have worthy results, it's expected you work 12+ hours a day, etc. I'm just not that cut-throat and it's really wearing on me. ,So, I started looking around and it turns out all the things I love about physics apply to data science. ,With that in mind, I've begun familiarizing myself with R and Python (my primary language right now is C++, but I've done some work with Python, Java, JS in the past). I've picked up the book ""Data Science from Scratch with Python"" and am going through it now. My postdoc will be up next June, and so I'm trying to start preparing my resume for applying for data science positions, and I was wondering - what else should I be doing? I'm working on projects on the side: I've just started studying machine learning algorithms (right now I'm working through understanding the ""Machine learning in 11 lines of Python"" example), I've been using a sample MLB data set to try to find if there is anything in the data that shows the influence of steroids (nothing obvious yet), I'm working on using Machine Learning to try to predict who will make it into the Hall of Fame, etc. But I feel like maybe I should be doing more? ,As an academic, my CV looks great... multiple papers as a primary author, many seminars and talks, a semester as a professor before this post doc, etc; but I was hoping folks from the DS world might give me some suggestions on what I should be doing more of now, so that come next June I can really jump into the data science world (and hopefully get paid more than my current woeful Postdoc salary).,Many thanks,,Zach ,I would look at some transition role - loads of quantitative roles in finance or even tech hire PhDs with good track record but little commercial experience. UK based, but look at Winton capital, these sort of guys are exactly who you should market yourself to. They want smart girls and guys with an aptitude for research and analysis, and offer training in specific areas of interest.,I don't have any ties to this place whatsoever, but know of them from the conference circuit in the bay area - Insight Data Science. They offer a 7 week tuition free postdoctoral training fellowship, and prep you to go from academia to the data science job world. I think they guarantee to place you too. Might be worth checking out!,Preface:  On paper, I'm probably not what most people think of when they think of an aspiring data scientist, but it's something that I find very intriguing and I believe I would be quite good at it.,Getting right down to it, here are some key points about myself:  ,I'm in my mid 30s.
I do not have a college degree.
I haven't actually ever taken any statistics courses.
I have a sales background in the automotive industry.,Convinced that data science is the right career path for me yet?  No?  Didn't think so.  ,When it comes to mathematics, I'm a very fast learner.  I haven't ever taken statistics, but I have tutored people in college level stats courses.  I did quite well on the first two Actuarial examinations.  My current job, while sales oriented, has allowed me the opportunity to pursue IT and basic data science-ish related projects, the biggest of which was to extract data from thousands of XML files and tweak it so as to be useful in our company's internal catalog system and website.  Over the past few years, I've been able to pick up a reasonable amount of SQL experience (and naturally, Access and Excel), and I'm currently learning R through various sources.  I'm going through the Coursera Data Science Specialization at the moment and finding it useful for someone at my level. ,I think I'd be a good candidate for an entry level data science position except for the fact that I don't have any formal education past high school.  I'm in my 30s now and have more financial responsibilities than I used to, so quitting work and going back to get a degree is not a real option.  So, my question is how does someone in my position break into the data science field?  Do I get my feet wet as an entry level data analyst and move on from there?  Or is there a better option out there? ,Need advice on pursuing the right masters in data science program:,I am wrapping up my undergrad in Computational Mathematics at UCLA. I have a strong math and CS background; some stats as well. I want to pursue a masters in data science because I feel that my undergrad is too general and I think data science is a great application of my current knowledge base. Plus, it seems a masters in data science would funnel me into a specific job which is what I feel like I need.,I am considering the Masters in Computer Science with a Specialization in Data Science at USC. My only concern is that it may also be too general and not be sufficient to land me a job as a Data Scientist once I graduate. I could instead hold out for other masters programs in data science specifically.
Thoughts?,Data Science masters programs are so new, all of the data scientists I work with just have degrees in CS, stats, etc. so I wouldn't worry about it. What you really need to get out of the next few years are:,1) a piece of paper that says you have a MS in any field related to data science,2) internship experience in data science,3) solid foundation in data science, which you can get either in your program or through online classes, extra reading, and projects.,It might be harder to pick up all the knowledge you need through a general program, but nobody will care if your degree is in CS or data science as long as you have the knowledge.,From what I've seen, it's actually more often recommended to have a more general graduate degree (CS or Stats, for example) than a Data Science one. Masters in CS with Data Science specialization sounds like a great idea.,A lot people will take real experience over an  MS in Data Science. Most of the programs are still quite new and from what I heard add questionable value to your profile.  Data Science jobs are growing linearly whereas applicants for Data Science jobs are growing exponentially .. good tidbit to keep in mind.,I'm a Communication and Multimediadesign student from the Netherlands who's rounding up his bachelors with an internship at a creative digital agency. So, I'm coming from a bit of a strange direction, having studied design the last four years. Now, I'm not exactly sure what everything is called in english, but before my final internship I followed a so called 'Minor' (a half year course). My minor was about Dataviz, and that's what got me interested. ,This minor mainly focussed on the graphic part of the data, but I was more interested in the analysis part.
My final internship was at a creative digital agency, with some pretty big clients. My job was to visualize, analyze and provide insights in the dataset of a pretty big chain of hotels.,To do so, I started out in excel but quickly dropped it in favor of R, which I then taught myself. I found R pretty easy to pick up, except that the syntax was a bit strange sometimes (coming from Javascript). So with R I cleaned up the data, and started adding variables of my own. For example there were columns about the number of adults, children and babies and I turned these into shortcodes (1A1C0B, for example) so I could visualize these. So that's the kind of stuff I did, just simple statistics, calculating averages or sums and visualizing these in simple charts using R. Now, this stuff actually brought some interesting insights and the internship company would really like to keep me, and educate me further so they can keep me on as a Data Scientist/Analyst.,My problem is; I'm unsure on what fields I should further educate myself. I really like digging through data, building scripts and creating insights. Motivation isn't the problem either. I just don't know where to go from here.
I think I need a lot more math and statistic knowledge, but I could also benefit greatly from enlarging my programming knowledge. I think I already have a decent sense on what marketable insights are, and where businesses could find interesting oppertunities.,So what I'm looking for is some advice on where to go now. Currently I'm eyeballing this study: , I'd love to hear your opinions about this study, and any other options I could look at.,Thanks a bunch!,This looks very similar to the masters of open source data science and this page, ,Good to know there are a few places that recommend the same study courses. I'd really like to follow this path, seems daunting to start with linear algebra when I really want to learn python and the linear algebra but these pages make it seem like the whole thing starts with algebra which is understandable.,Thank you for your story, how o you think is it possible to find remote internship in data science or same specialization?,I just finished my PhD in computational neuroscience and want to start a career in data science. I'm competent in machine learning/stats/hypothesis testing/R/python, but I'm lacking experience outside of academia (which was the #1 reason for my rejected job applications so far).,I have two job offers:,1) Data science consultant at a large tech consulting firm. 
Pro: I would get to know a lot of different businesses, which is what I'm lacking right now.
Con: High stress potential, a lot of traveling, and likely a pretty bad work-life-balance.,2)  Data scientist at an ecommerce startup (~60 employees). I would be the first data scientist there and would have quite some freedom in what I can do.
Pro: Cool people, more freedom, better work-life-balance.
Con: No mentors that I can learn from, less variety, and company is less known.,In the long term, I don't see myself staying in consulting, and would want a more relaxed job in a less conservative business. But right now, I think it would give me the best learning experience due to the task variety and availability of mentors I could learn from.,Any advice on which offer I should take? Related question: How is work experience in data science consulting generally viewed by companies that hire data scientists?,Data Scientists in the consulting practices of IBM and Booz often jump into the startup / tech world. You should have no problem changing paths. Consulting is not fun at all as you clearly delineated. I personally would choose the startup. Although you have no mentor, you could make some serious waves. You will eventually have to specialize. Consultants are generalists. Specializing in eCommerce transactional data sounds pretty good to me.,I second this. Getting deep domain knowledge allows you to differentiate yourself very easily, and can lead to a lucrative career path going forward. ,Just reaching end of year two as a PhD (Computing but applied) student (UK) and have the concern about what to do after (job or academia):,I have spent most of my PhD working with eye tracking data taken during clinical procedures with analysis done in R along with some regression modelling but my skills are still pretty fresh compared to what I see out there from others.,My main concern is always about maths or rather the need for it as a prerequisite for really getting into data science/ML. I don't hate maths and I'm not totally awful but it's really not my thing - I'd personally much rather take an applied approach and find insights rather than worry about optimising ML algorithms etc. Is there any advice for people like me who struggle with their math background and would still like to get into the industry?  Or is this a bad path to pursue and would there be better alternatives for someone like me?,Hey I'm nearly done writing my PhD thesis and managed to get full time work as a senior analyst mainly doing reporting for a large energy company. They don't currently do anything using advanced math or stats which is what I'm going to try introduce but my maths background isn't great. There's definitely big companies out there interested in getting in PhDs to investigate their data.,I am working full time as a DBA in a large organization and would like to shift my career towards Data analytics. I have a bachelors in CS and already a Master's in MIS. I am looking at online programs and I started my term at Texas A&M this summer but then data analytics program at CUNY and Penn State caught my attention. I liked CUNY program more as its more broad and covers a lot of other areas. Texas A&M seems heavily focused on R and SAS particularly. Also i would like to mention that my employer is willing to cover tuition up to 15k, So if i continue with TAMU then i will have to pay out of the pocket(which i don't mind if it's worth it), but that will cover CUNY tuition. So does anyone here have any experience or feedback with the two programs or any other similar program? Also if MS is Statistics will hold more value or vocational degree like Data Analytics? 
Any thoughts or feedbacks are welcomed!,I currently work in finance and would like to learn more about data science to both improve my career prospects and see how it can be incorporated into my department. I'm currently teaching myself R and Python, which is going fairly smoothly since I've been using VBA and SQL for years, but my math background is where I'm lacking. I took some basic statistics classes (intro to statistics, econometrics) when I was at uni a few years ago, as well as some above entry level math classes (calc 3, ""intro to proof writing"" which was basically a low level set theory class), but beyond that, nothing. ,Is getting into data science completely off the table given my lack of math credentials? would taking any MOOCs help address this, and if so where would be a good place to start, or has the ship sailed?,*edit Supposedly this guy is OG in data science. ,My friend has a bio background and doing well as a data scientist consultant. I wouldn't shy away with a lack of math.,I'm still an amateur, so take this with a grain of salt.
I'd also like to share my strategy for learning data science so far.,I have a math background, which is useful but not required. Knowing linear algebra and differential equations, some analysis stuff is useful for developing a deeper intuition into how the machine is learning, but not necessary. IMO data science is a life long journey as it can be applied to many fields. It may be useful to learn more math later on as it get's deeper, but surface level knowledge should suffice.,For linear algebra, I've found the first lecture to be the most useful. , It basically describes how we can translate lines into vectors and find solutions. It may be useful for continue learning, but in the beginning I believe surface understanding should suffice. If you're looking to build new data analytic tools, understanding the maths at depth is a must. But if your goal is to apply the tools already in existence, you can get by with a brief understanding. ,For example, I have a weak statistics background; for the things I don't know I look them up on wikipedia, various sites, etc. The goal is not necessarily to learn the material as you would for an exam, but to develop a broader understanding of what the material is and how it is relates to machine learning. When I read this material I probably retain only 5-15% of the information, but I read enough to let me move on. Never get stuck on one piece of information for too long. I've found if I get stuck, I can move on and the brain just kind of figures out how it fits into the puzzle.,With your background Andrew Ng's course on coursera , should be suitable.,I watch these videos only once on 2x speed. My goal is not to retain the information but to index it. Much of what is useful will be learned by practice, by watching the videos on 2x it's like skimming a text. It allows you to index, that way you know where to look if you need greater depth in the future. For example, you don't have to memorize the cost function, but it's important to know why the cost function is constructed the way it is, and what it's use is.,I then supplement by reading this: ,and doing these problems ,This is the most useful resource I've found tbh:
,I have a weak programming background, so for learning python I've found this text useful for practice and learning the language: ,This text is very basic, useful in general if you don't have a compsci/compeng background, but doesn't have direct applications for data science. For a more data focus wrt python: , . You do not have to pay for any of these courses. Just search for the specific course and enroll, for example, ,That's pretty much where I'm at.
I believe the most important thing is to train our brains to think as the machine would. It's important to utilize our intuition and natural parallel abilities of the brain, as ultimately these are the techniques we are attempting to replicate.,This is a huge help. I can't thank you enough. ,Thank you for you story and links, i found it very useful for me.,I have a bioinformatics backround and am currently persuing a masters in DS. How did he break into the field if you dont mind me asking?,My friend got in by applying for the job. I don't know the details, his first job was something or another with amazon analyzing data (not ML stuff). Then he switched to his current job. Pretty sure he developed his skillset on his own, but other companies are training their own employees for the job.,DS isn't like medicine or actuaries where there is a certification program. Nor is it like investment banking where you need to know the right people to get in. A decent place to start is building a small portfolio to show off your capabilities. It's the best way to show you know what your doing without work experience.,Hi my undergraduate was in Marketing. My first job was working as data mining and data analysis in a big e-commerce firm for 2 years . Then I went overseas to study my MBA. I am now working in a publishing firm as Marketing for 2.5 years already. However I found big data analysis and data mining are still really interesting to me. Thus I have finished a MySQL course in Coursera and now I am studying Python also in Coursera. I am thinking to get a official certificate from a sounded university for further approach my career path. I am considering the Data Science Certificate from the Harvard University. It's very expensive , may I know does anyone know more about the industry and think is it worth it ? ,Thanks,
V ,I need some advice about what grad school programs to apply to. I'm not sure if it'd be better to apply to Data Science / Analytics masters programs (at USF or UVA for example), or Applied Math Masters programs (like at USC or UCSD). I'm a rising senior studying engineering and math and am hoping to start grad school next fall.,Why not a Masters in CS or something similar? ,I'm trying to prepare for an internship in Summer 2017, and have been self-teaching and self-studying this summer. Among things being self-taught, I've gone through Python to a decent extent, and have begun working on R. I'm really comfortable with Java, so do have some programming experience under my belt and some side-projects coded in Java. ,Now, graduating in Fall 2018 I'm starting my senior sequence as a math major(last semester is for a couple of classes to close out my CS minor) and chose to do Stochastics, which follows up with Intro to Options. I'm just kinda wondering what else I should work on teaching myself over the rest of this summer as well as throughout my free time in the upcoming semesters. ,My preparation is not only for the internship, but possibility of hitting up grad school for maybe Machine Learning or Statistics(only going for Master's, likely not PhD). I've considered going through a Numerical Analysis textbook, but not sure where else to go to help better myself for what's to come that isn't a side-project.,Any help/guidance would be much appreciated!,[deleted],Especially if you are looking for a job within the company you should ask internally and it gives a good impression.,[deleted],Does your company use yammer? If so, I bet there's some data science / analytics / enterprise business intelligence group.,anyone know of any great websites where they have data science tutors?, is good for programming and app development tutors. I have no personal experience with their Data Science experts. Try out a session.,There are also a ton of Data Scientists on ,. Most of them do contract assignments, but I bet you could reach out to some for tutoring help.,I'm going to be a senior at univeristy, majoring in Management Information Systems. I'm interested in data science as a career, but I guess ,I don't have a ton of experience with the two but this year I plan on trying to get better with them with on the side projects. Thanks peeps!,I am a process engineer and for part of my job I work with large data sets regularly for process controls and efficiency modeling. I've started teaching myself SQL and Python. I was accepted into a bootcamp for data science, but ultimately turned it down because I don't have as much faith in bootcamps helping me make a career jump.,The only part of my job I enjoy is modeling data and using large data sets to detect patterns and make process decisions and I generally dislike the manufacturing/process engineering lifestyle other than that.,I'm looking at going to grad school to get a MS in Business Analytics, preferably with a specialization in Data Science. Wondering if anyone has experience with programs at UT Austin, UC Denver, Denver University, or CU Boulder (living in Austin, really trying to move back to CO). If anyone has any other general advice, that'd be welcome as well.
Thanks!,Data Science bootcamps are pretty new. Is the fact that you have to quit your job and commit full-time daunting without knowing about potential outcomes? Or are you just wary of how new and untested these private education certificates are?,Mostly wary about how new they are and also skeptical that a bootcamp with nothing more than a certificate would help me make the industry switch. Paying 16k for an immersive bootcamp and then not getting a new job was a risk I didn't feel like taking. Hoping to get into grad school next year to just get the solid MS. ,Ok, I totally understand your point of view. My good friend, who was a website designer, went to one. After graduating he got 3 offers, Data Scientist @ Booz, IBM and a medium-sized ad-tech firm. All in the NYC area.  Recently, I started working with him to flesh out an online, part-time iteration of the current bootcamp model. I see tons of engineers and data/business analysts that have the drive and technical fundamentals, but are stuck in a certain career path, thinking about grad school or wary of bootcamps.,It is an uphill battle to change people's perception, especially when you are trying to launch a new one with no track record. Thanks.,Am I going to the right way in becoming a data analyst?,I am working as a marketer now in a publisher company but I found the position really doesn't helped me to grow my career path. I had worked in an e-commerce firm before. My position was consultant but my job duty included data analysis which I found great job satisfaction there. So now I would like to pursue back to that field.,I have just finished a MySQL course by Coursera a few months ago and now I am doing a Python course. (I was just using Excel & Microstrategy in the previous job) I went to an interview in an internet company of the data insight position but not successful in the end unfortunately. May I know am I going into a right direction in becoming a data analyst? Is there any formal certificate I should study?,I am thinking about the Data Science Certificate by the Harvard Extension School, but it needs at least 1.5 years and it is quite expensive (around US$10,000). May I know does anyone has studied this certificate or heard of it? Is it good and worth it? Or I should study more by myself from the internet? Would employer cares about if you have a formal certificate or not?,What else requirement do I need to become a data analyst? Especially in an internet or ecommerce firm?,What especially do I need to prepare if I get another interview next time?,I would say be prepared to talk about the work that you are doing. If you can show examples of projects that you have worked on, particularly those that are relevant to the company that you are interviewing for. ,I wouldn't put too much stock in a data science certificate. ,For internet ecommerce, you should do analysis on the conversion funnel or some other user activity metric for a project. ,What are the most important things that recruiters look at for a data scientist ? I am masters student with focus on machine learning ,Recruiters will pitch anyone who has done the base tools (and can vaguely talk about datascience). ,In terms of skillset, for hiring managers, you should look to the , to figure out what skills you need to acquire. ,I graduated in May with a BS in chemistry (and a minor in English lit). I came across data science about a year ago and I've become rather interested in it; however, I don't have any experience in anything related. I did take an intro to programming course (Java) at uni and really enjoyed that and did fairly well on it, but that's the extent of my experience. 
My questions are:,1) Can I break into the field by doing an MS in data science? I found a few programs geared towards non-CS majors such as ,2) I am taking this year off (hoping to find a short term job until I start my masters), is it worth doing online courses such as the ones mentioned on this subreddit to get a head start and better footing?,3) Is it an advantage to come from a non-CS scientific background?,4) Is it necessary to do a PhD later on, or would an MS like the one mentioned above suffice? I don't particularly want to stay in academia for too long, so I'm hoping an MS would be enough. ,Thanks in advance!,1) Absolutely. I personally don't put too much stock into masters programs yet, but they can be good if you need the structure/signaling mechanism. Looking at the site, i don't see a detailed curricula so it's difficult to tell whether this is a great fit. ,2) Definitely start learning. you may find that the projects that you do will be very helpful for your work. Just keep in mind that some of the tools/frameworks you will be learning may be more advanced than what you learn in class. ,3) No. CS backgrounds / programming experience are almost always critical for datascience roles. You won't be writing an operating system or having to understand memory allocation (like a typical CS degree) but you will have to be able to solve problems via code. 
 The joke is that datascience is the intersection of statistics, programming, and product knowledge. ,4) PhDs are absolutely not necessary.  ,How do I land a Data Science focused Data Analysis role? I am well versed with Excel, currently learning VBA and R (is this redundant?), intermediate level T-SQL skills, and some data mining skills (decision trees, random forests, regression, and clustering). Also brushing up on my Algebra and Statistics. I've still got a ways to go with stats.,B.S. in Business management and administration while currently working as a Data Entry hamster for a company that has no structure for professional development.,VBA and R are not exactly interchangeable, I'd work on learning R/Python in the long term. ,Learning VBA in your ""Data Entry hamster"" role will likely make your bosses extremely impressed with you as you can probably automate 90% of your job within the existing processes in VBA. ,Anyone here involved in health related research?,I'm a 36year old software product manager who did an engineering undergrad, but am feeling really caught in middle management.,Software has always frustrated me, but I think if I had a bigger goal/vision I could fight my way through it.,Would love to hear what a typical day looks like, analyzing data sets, which technologies apply, pros and cons, etc.,I've spoken to a 100+ recruiters, it's really tough for a fresher like me. There's no direction, there's no hope. Just continuing efforts to do projects so that I can improve my profile and get recruiters to look at it. But all they want is experience, even for internships they want experience! It really frustrates me, have shifted my focus to Software Engineering now, since I don't have experience. Feeling hopeless, should I try harder? Is anyone in the same boat?,I'm graduating May 2017 but I don't see myself getting a job till then.,Github: github.com/vivekpatani
LinkedIn: LinkedIn.com/in/vivekpatani
Site: vivekpatani.tk,Right now I'm doing a maths / CS dual major, but really want to drop the CS because the curriculum just isn't my thing (too focused towards building software and systems and whatnot). Maths is my passion but I'm terrified that if I go 100% into it and don't get into a good graduate program I'm going to be dead in the water career wise. So I was wondering if any of you guys could give me an idea of how hard it would be to get into data science with a maths degree, assuming I do have the CS skills, just not a piece of paper that says it. Thanks!,Not sure if this is an appropriate subreddit for me to post on, but I currently work in business development (sales) for an enterprise software company and am looking to transition more into a business/data analytics role. I am wondering how feasible this jump would be, given that it is a lateral career jump and most of the typical responsibilities for those roles aren't really there in my current role. I am currently picking up SQL and Tableau to make myself more marketable, but what else can I do to transition into these careers? Should I quit my job and pursue a full-time program like , or , or should I continue my current role, pick up skills on the side, and continue to apply in hopes of getting a job somewhere? I graduated last year from an Ivy-League school, with a degree in Economics and I have some knowledge of Python with strong Excel/VBA skills.,Your goal should be to get a first job as a data analyst/business intelligence analyst. ,Here's what I recommend to reach that goal:,Also, you should try finding businesses where your past experience can be leveraged. For example, Close.io is hiring a ""Technical Marketer"": ,. They are building sales communication platform. Your biz dev experience can be leveraged in that case.,Should I take AP Statistics or AP Calc my HS senior year? Stats seems better but I heard going into Calc in college without any experience is tough,You should take both if you can, but if you can only take one, take calculus. It'll give you a great foundation for more math classes in college including statistics.,I know this is a late response but I'm about to be a Junior in College and I took both AP Stats & AP Calc in high school. I'd suggest taking both if you can swing it. If you can only take one, I would suggest taking AP Calc. Most of the people I know who didn't take it in high school had to spend a lot more time and effort getting up to speed at the university level. In high school it's okay to take a little longer to wrap your head around different calculus concepts, but college-level calc moves at a pretty fast pace and goes much deeper; having to spend extra time to understand certain concepts can be really tough in college, especially when you have a bunch of other classes that you need to study for as well. 
  That being said, I think you'll be fine either way, but it definitely is a huge help if you can come into school already having that foundation. ,[deleted],All those programs are all probably really new so you wont find much experience with their admissions process. Your description makes you sound weak in most of the  fundamental parts of data science interview/jobs Programming,Math, Statistics,Machine Learning. I would focus on Math, programming, statistics. The masters program should be finishing school not a rework from the ground up. ,You seem to know what you're talking about. Do you think an Econ major from a well known school with significant math background (Calc I,Ii,III, Lin Alg, Diff eq, introductory statistics and maybe probability this semester) and some computer science background is better, or a big but less prestigious school with a CS degree is better for data science? I don't know what I specifically want to do inside the field since I'm still exploring but want someone else's point of view,I would take on less debt. ,I'm currently working as a data analyst / Web analyst in a startup for two years. I want to be better data analyst (I am not from IT or data science background). What can I do / learn daily to improve myself?,So I'm looking to transition from my role as a business analyst/project manager to a job as a data scientist with a new firm. I currently have a background in statistics and economics and I'm looking at my options to round out my data science skills so that I can get a new job as a data scientist with a new firm in a new industry.,So far from what I have gathered there are a few options. I'll need online options since I don't want to quit my day job.,What do you all think about these options? Is there anything missing? ,2) if you dont want to hedge your risks for a job
4) otherwise,I'm a recent graduate with a BS in Economics and BA in Psychology.  I have experience using SPSS, Stata, Excel, and Tableau.  I am learning Python and SQL currently as well as doing a course in Machine Learning.  I have worked as a research assistant for the past year, but beyond that do not have much relevant experience.,My problem is that I have not had any luck finding a job as a data analyst.  Is there any key ingredient I'm missing or is it a matter of fixing resumes and cover letters and being persistent?,Persistence - keep it up!
I was in your boat (or, an extremely similar boat) a year ago and I've since gotten my full start in the industry.,Where are you looking for positions? Universities? Think Tanks? Marketing Research was the route I took - I was able to pivot off of a minor in Business Marketing, but you absolutely have tons of relevant skills. Keep it up!,Like the other respondent I got my foot in the door through a market research position. I was persistent and just kept escalating my research (they wanted to know the about last 6 months, I threw in the next 3 for free sort of deal) and eventually they created a position for me.,I obtained my MS (Statistics) recently and have a few interviews lined up. Some of these include titles like ""entry level data scientist,"" ""junior data scientist,"" etc. Frankly I'm not the most knowledgeable about this field and I'm freaking out a little bit.,I don't really have relevant work experience - my resume just includes a really nice GPA, and some brief descriptions of the statistics projects I did during my MS (which I can explain pretty comfortably). I've been updating my GitHub as well with hopefully relevant material, as well as trying my best to continue picking up new skills in the last few weeks via videos and tutorials (and I plan to continue this process while working).,Bonus info: I know that in my upcoming interview, the company's analytics team is hiring their first set of data scientists, and I feel like I can take advantage of this fact to stand out against the other applicants somehow. Something tells me the company doesn't really know what they're looking for either.,I know this is a super vague question, but uh...any tips for preparation for the interview?,Given that you are applying for junior data scientist position that along puts you leaps above the I just half took an MOOC on ML now give me job crowd.,I was in the same situation as you in April with the same degree.

I would like to build upon my background in supply chain, logistics, and manufacturing. ,My question involves getting another masters degree (paid for by my work). I am debating between a MS Statistics and a MS Operations Research. I get that statistics seems to be more in line with data science, however, optimization and systems modeling in OR seems more applicable to the field in which I'd like to work as a data scientist.,Thoughts?,MS OR seems redundant if you have an MBA in supply chain management. An MS Statistics would at least make it look like you are perfecting your fundamentals.,Currently pursuing a Computer Science Bachelors, wondering if it's worth it to pursue a Statistics minor alongside this. ,Im a finance/eco double major with a CS minor.

Should I attempt to do a double degree as in BCOMM and BCompSci to maximize my chances ? Thank you,If you don't have to spend extra money or take an extra year, get the double degree.,A comp sci minor should include the necessary knowledge to work as a data scientist (intro to comp sci, intro to algorithms and intro to machine learning). You need some coursework in stats & probability. Choose Python or R and roll with it.,[deleted],You shouldn't have to take another minor to help get you into the data science world. I would hope their ""data science program"" covers all the basics and more. ,If you want to minor in something, do something that interests you in the liberal arts. Become more well-rounded.,[deleted],You definitely have a shot and your passion definitely is in the whole data science area.,You should be able to compete with 'real CS' majors, a lot of what is taught in school is very theoretical/ doesn't provide real world examples of problems to be solved. In my experience, half of our new CS candidates often botch the data validation/data munging steps in our interview process and wonder why their analysis is all over the place .,You should be able to spin your experience in such a way that it is mostly relevant but you should get additional experience in the distributed datasts/large cluster/hadoop-esque packages side. ,You don't have to learn all of the tools just learn one set of tools that shows you understand the process and show that you can use the tools to solve the issues that a company will have. ,[deleted],What's your timeline on this?

I'm planning on getting a MS in computer science, but I'm wondering if this is still a viable path for a data science job.,No. A lot of data science is going to be data visualization and working with large datasets, there is some predictive modeling but for the most part, the PhD level stats stuff is probably too mathematical/theoretical (unless stats programs have done a 180 in the last 3 years). ,I would love some advice. I've spent the past 8 years working as a research assistant in academic research (cognition and behavioral neuroendocrinology) and I'm trying to transition into data science. Presumably I need to start small and look at data analyst roles since I don't have a masters/phd , my bachelors isn't in math/comp sci/stats...everything meaningful I've learned has been learned on-the-job. I have a ton of experience with ETL, data cleaning, analysis, and a bunch of languages and packages, but all have been used in an academic research context.,Unsurprisingly I'm having difficulty breaking into even analyst roles. Does anyone have any advice for getting in on the ground floor?,You should be able to transition into a data analyst / junior data scientist role. Do you have good experience with visualization packages? Have you prepped a github portfolio? ,90% of data science is data munging (etl/ transformations/ data cleaning and oh god DE-DUPING).,Hi all! I'm interested in becoming a data scientist and am not sure if a program like , at CMU is technical enough for me to get a job a top tech company. ,Is it fair to say that programs that usually have the word ""analytics"" in them are not technical enough (stats wise and cs wise) to really get you a data science job such as  ,would the program above, count as an MS in CS or Statistics or similar?,Doubtful.

And 3 java courses and an course in R do not make for an MS in CS either. ,True, I was coming to that realization yesterday and that I should be looking at stats or select operations research masters. ,Do you think doing a masters in stats/operations research will be enough to be a data scientist? Should I look to do maybe a 2 years masters with a semester or two of research? I kinda answered this myself in another post of mine, but it seems like data scientist positions are usually only open to PhDs?,Phds are one route, practical experience is the other. There is a thread on building a portfolio somewhere on here.,If you can use the tools and do the job, why wouldnt they hire you? My biggest knock on phds is the inability for them to use the existing data tools that are typically used. ,It's almost like hiring a contractor who wants to build his own nailgun first. ,I've recently graduated with a BSc in Math and had the awesome opportunity to work as a mathematical modeling and OR analyst for a research group for three years during my undergrad. I'm trying desperately to get a job in data science but can't even seem to get an interview! I'm also taking the Machine Learning course by the University of Washington on Coursera.,As of right now, I'm kind of just accepting RAs and TA appointments at my university while I figure things out. I can't seem to get a job in data science and a I need a job, so I'm doing an ""unclassified"" year at my uni while I RA/TA and look for a job.

I would love to go to the US but what are the protocols for applying to US companies and ensuring them I'm serious and willing to move?,Howdy!,Just finished up a BS in Physics and realized I really disliked Physics but loved problem solving. I love computers as well. I've always been fascinated by data and the problems it can solve or predict. I figured problem solving + computers = data science.,I'm not sure if data science is for me, but I have a hunch that it might be.

I might have had the wrong idea about what data science was. Thanks!,Really? What do you think data science is? ,Rob hyndman has a great graph about this on his page ,I'd say that your profile is good enough (given some of the physics guys that work next to me) to get an entry level job doing the basic data analysis.... putting predictive modeling and big data on top of that is what separates 'analysis' from the 'science',I think I'd be much more interested in the analysis side of things. I just have zero experience with it. It seems like most of the entry level positions I've seen are geared towards people who have been coding in multiple languages for 2-3 years.,Right now I'm trying to justify taking coding classes or not. I'm torn between taking my first steps towards being a physics teacher (something I've always wanted to do, have pretty solid experience for, but my family isn't 100% behind), or trying something new like working with data (which I've always been jealous of watching other do and wanted to learn).,I had a taste of MATLAB coding in college and really enjoyed the puzzle assembly that was putting a code together to get the right output. I could really see myself using coding to solve big problems and trouble shoot, but I guess I don't know what I should be looking into. I thought it was data science, but I need to do some more research into what sort of entry-level stuff I should be looking into.,Hey gang, I have a question I think has probably been answered in one way or another about a million times.,I have a B.Sc. in both Pure and Applied Mathematics, and will be graduating shortly wiht a M.Sc. Computational Science and I have a bit of a way to go to be competitive for a Data Science(y) job, and my question is: where should I invest my time for maximum effect.,By this I mean, my skills are in scientific computing, machine learning, stats, simulation, high performance computing, and I am an advanced python, Matlab, R user, and have a beginner knowledge in Java, C, and Excel.

Any other suggestions on how someone who is , more experienced can enter the field.  ,In your resume/interviews I wouldnt market yourself as more experienced since even though the skills may translate the experience wont translate/count. Kind of have to swallow the pride and realize for the new field you are moving into you will be considered inexperienced,I'm clearly not the only one here who has taken an unusual route towards data science, but I'm wondering if I have any real chance of getting a job in the field - tough love time, please.,I have an undergraduate degree in history and am just starting a Masters in Computing. From what I know of data science it seems fascinating, but I have little maths background (being a history grad, I haven't done it since I left school). By next year I'll have a year of study under my belt, part of which will involve looking at big data, but with the focus being on software development in a very general sense.,Really, I'm looking for advice on whether I'd have realistically much chance at getting a job in this field (and what would be my best course of action over the next year or two to do so), or whether my qualifications and background would make it rather difficult. Like I say, tough love if necessary.,I am a recent Physics BS graduate with a minor in Mathematics.  I have about a year's experience coding on and off in Python as a research assistant, doing mainly device control stuff, although that gave me experience with Python in general (OOP) and a bit of familiarity with matplotlib and numpy.  I'm more comfortable with Mathematica for visualizations though, as I have used it for a year to solve math and ODE problems from class and graph solutions.,I'm currently considering going through the Microsoft Data Science curriculum on edX, and was wondering if this would be a good way to transition into an entry level job in Data Science in the near future (as in within a couple of months after completing the curriculum).  My school's department sent an e-mail about the Signal Data Science bootcamp in San Francisco, but due to plans this Fall, I wasn't able to go and would have to settle for online courses instead.  It's still a great deal assuming the edX courses can help me qualify for a job.,I also have graduate school in mind in the future, most likely in Physics (either an MS or a PhD).  Would this be a good route for Data Science?  From what one of the answers to another question said, it sounds like it is.,I would do a masters in CS with a focus in ML. Doing a PhD in Physics is overkill if your intent isnt physics.,Maybe I'll consider that when I apply to grad schools the upcoming months.  I was hoping to get my foot in the door with just a Bachelors in a quantitative degree, and the basic knowledge gained from 6-12 week long or online programs and learn more of the advanced stuff on the job.  That way I have something to do while I wait for grad school to begin, while also learning data science techniques which would likely prove useful in scientific research.,Hey guys, I am an undergraduate Mathematics major at UT with a concentration in Statistics, Probability and Data Analysis. I am a senior and last semester I added the certification in Statistical Modelling. I plan on working full-time after graduation and I feel like my best shot at getting a job with my academic background would be in the realm of Data Science. I am also a huge stats geek especially in sports. Sports analytics is ultimately where I would want to end up at. My cumulative GPA is embarrassingly low due to poor life choices and a wrong initial major. However, my Major GPA is in the 3.6-3.7 range. I have basic Python knowledge but not enough to use it to sort data or use it as a predictive tool (Right now I'm doing stuff like checking for primes, palindromes etc). This past summer I used R studio often for an Applied Statistics class and was acquainted with Minitab and JMP. In November, I would be enrolled in General Assembly on a part-time basis because I feel like I need to up my credentials, up my experience and learn how to code for statistical analysis and decision-making. Reading some of these threads have been intimidating to say the least. Not only can I not answer some examples of interview questions posted, I don't even know what they are talking about. L1, L2, K-means are all terms going above my head. Bluntly put, what do I need to do?,Hi!
I'm looking for a place in the world to base myself which is cheapish but has a good data science study group/kagglers.,I'm building up my skills with the Data Science Specialisation on coursera atm but I want to spend some time on side projects honing my skills. So having like minded people around would be great.,I have roughly from late Jan to mid March before I have to disappear for a month. But I might have some more time after that.,PS I'm an Ozzie so getting into most countries isn't too hard,Hi guys,Background:  a summary of my experience is I have a BSc Physics, MSc Computer Science and MSc Data Science all at very good universities.  Before doing my MSc Data Science I also completed two years on a business and technology consulting graduate scheme.  I would say that this experience was minimal in terms of technical skills I learnt but you could say that I learnt a lot of soft skills.,Aim:  I am interested in earning as much money as possible to give my family a good life.  I don't think I'm naturally smart enough to work in the big technology giants (e.g. Google, Facebook) but I was wondering the following what are the good options for ordinary people like me who can perform well when they work hard.  Particularly, I am interested in:,I'm wondering about what sort of qualifications I'd need to be considered for a data science role. Would a BS in physics, 2-3 years in professional experience in software development roles, and a verified coursera machine learning specialization completion certificate make me a viable candidate in the field?,Hello! My Question is basically 'to what extent does my experience so far help with getting into data science, and to what extent might it help with the fact that I don't have the usual data scientist academic bakground?',My background is this: ,I think the move to predictive modelling team is definitely a step in the right direction CV wise but it certainly wont teach me everything I need to know to become a fully fledged data scientist.,I've just started to learn R and it seems there's plenty of information and educational material online. The question is, should I invest the time required to fill the gaps in my knowledge (a lot by the sounds of it!) or do I have little chance of securing a position with my lack of a scientific/mathematical degree?,I see plenty of Economics majors in the Data Science field (working in a Finance role that regularly interacts with Data Science teams). So I don't believe that would be a disadvantage. The value of Data Science/being a Data Scientist isn't just about being able to code, an arguably bigger part of the value you provide will be what insight you are able to present. Which as an Economics major (bias as an Econ major myself) I would argue you have the advantage in (on average). ,As for where your focus should be definitely learn as much as you can on the coding side. Python, R, SQL, etc would be the ones to hit. Generally for the Data Scientists I talk to there is a technical ""bar"" that you should be able to get over. After that it's much more about what you actually can ""do"" with that data. What insight you can drive, your thought process, etc etc. ,I'm about to start undergrad in the UK in astrophysics. I initially wanted to go into research, but I'm becoming more and more interested in data science, particularly the machine learning aspect and the algorithmic aspect. Should I just finish my Bachelors, and then do a Masters in Data Science? Or should I just go onto an Astrophysics Masters? What about PhD? There are certain research areas in astro that has huge amounts of data, so finding a suitable project wouldn't be a problem. (Note: - I really wouldnt mind doing a PhD if I could, since I really like astrophysics!).
Cheers.,I reckon a PhD in astrophysics plus plenty of experience of working with data and skills in R and/or Python would be a fairly employable CV.,Hello everyone,,I'm 11 years into a good career in IT, where I'm now in the middle management in a large CPG company (ie I have managers below me, and above me). This is boring as hell, all I do is politics. 
One of my teams is building a big data system for CRM data, and I find the perspective of this incredible.
I would like the following things :
- understand better what my team does(which is more data engineering)
- understand what my data scientists will do
- possibly shift my career in that space, possibly staying as a manager,If we take the 3 circles of data scientists, I have domain knowledge (CPG, retail, CRM, digital marketing), hacking knowledge fundations (I know Python and SQL, learning R, need to learn about the tools like hadoop/Spark), but I have 0 math background (or I had, but forgot all of it),Currently taking the Coursera Data Science specialization, R part is OK but I fear for the stats part.,I posted here on how to get the fundamental of math I would need : ,Anyone here did a similar move? 
Any tips?,Hello all:,I am looking to make a career change into the data science field.,Currently, I am in need of boosting my math skills and I am considering going back to school to get a BS in either mathematics or physics.  I am also going to take as many stats classes that I can regardless of which degree path I choose."
"Maybe I don't understand something, but how can ""velocity"" define a data? Velocity is a perfomance of processing data, but not the term to define a data itself. Am I wrong?,Processing Gigabytes of data per second can be as complex an exercise as processing Petabytes daily. Probably more complex TBH.,I know, but depending on what technologies you're using, you can process different amount of data in different time. For example person A with technologies used X can process 100 Gb of data for 1 second, while person B using technologies named Y can process 1 Tb of data for the same 1 second. So velocity itself can't define, how big the data is. Or am I wrong with the definition of velocity?,I think velocity, volume, etc are intended as metrics that define the practical limits of traditional/single machine approaches to storing, retrieving and analyzing data.,So a data stream with a velocity of 100gb/sec would probably pose difficulty storing data using conventional tools. Thus it is ""big"". ,Big in big data just means it can't be handled with conventional tools, its not necessarily a measure of size. Velocity isnt a measure of data's size, but it is a measurement that may qualify a data pipeline as ""big"".,Some who refer to big data projects are talking about dealing with a static offline data set.  I see velocity to define the rate at which new data is arriving that must be processed before it is useful.  ,So, you're correct that velocity is partially determined by the performance of processing the data, but that's not all...  I guess I'd say the processing performance determines the latency along with communication latencies.. but the rate at which the data is produced determines the velocity.,Ex, with IoT sensor data being collected every 10ms and millions of sensors there is a much higher velocity of data being generated than a database receiving 100 orders per day.  If they're processed later in a 30day batch report, the IoT sensor scenario still has a higher velocity.. but they both have the same latency.,Velocity can mean how fast it is processed and how fast it is acquired in the first place. But my main point is, say, even if some central server at McDonald's acquired all orders at once in continuous time, the company probably wouldn't need to do much with that data immediately. The ""real time analysis"" of streaming data is a less often encountered part of big data. Hence few (in relative terms) companies actually deal with that. I work at a company where we'll get dozens of Gb of data in an hour, but that's the raw stuff. What gets to me much later is dozens of Mb, from which I get insights that will eventually turn into some real time analysis features. So, while my company does deal with big data, in the 3V sense, a lot of the work does not.,As the others have said, the velocity of data is generally considered the rate at which new data is coming in, so it is not really about any single datum, but rather the data set as a whole.,A common example of the velocity of data is Twitter (and more broadly data stream mining). The speed at which new tweets are created makes doing almost anything with it impossible. Certainly no super-linear algorithms ( O(nlog(n)) or anything like that) is able to keep up, and often even sub-linear algorithms in O(log(n)) are often necessary if you want to have any live analyses. A lot of pretty standard approaches just no longer work, and break when you have that. Even counting things can be challenging.,So when Velocity is used to define big data, it is this axis of a , (rather than the individual datums themselves) that is generally being considered. If we take the Big Data stance of ""it's the data that makes everything break"", then when you have a data set increasing in size so fast that they had to change their entire database infrastructure just to manage ID creation (,), you start to get an idea of why Velocity is added to the 3V's of Big Data,I work for a company in the fitness & wellness space, and I would say we have ""kinda big data"".  Our SQL-based data warehouse started to exceed the daily SLAs for having executive reports ready because it was just getting too big (most fact tables in the 100M+ rows).  We moved from SQL Server/Informatica to S3/Redshift/Spark.  In the meantime, we started to ingest some large data sets (web & app tracking data, realtime data from about 10,000 stationary bikes & treadmills around the world all emitting messages 10 times per second (so at 1Kb messages, that's about a terabyte every three hours), realtime beacon data).,As the first ""data scientist"" (put it in quotes because even though I have 18 years of engineering / analytic / ML experience, I only have a bachelor's degree so I doubt i'd get taken seriously calling myself a data scientist), the advantage of replatforming to me was that I could start to build smart systems like recommendation engines, chatbots, and data products on top of a more flexible, open-source environment.  Other than trying to detect malfunctioning hardware in our fitness centers, there's nothing that I would say requires something distributed like Spark (do people seriously put themselves through the hassle of using hadoop any more now that Spark is so gangsta?) but our data engineers love it, it's several orders of magnitude cheaper than anything else (because we use EMR so we only pay for compute time we use) so our VP loves it, and I have the ability to do make some pretty boss data science pipelines for stuff like personalization & modelling.,Isn't that a shame that the ""data science"" brigade would be so dismissive of you, with just a Bachelors, but nearly two decades of experience? ,The worst thing the tech has ever done for the meritocratic culture, IMO, was to give academics such a foot hold into the industry. Worst, not just a foothold, but actually fetishize them. It use to be people were applauded if they were so good they never even finished school. Now, everyone wants three advanced degrees and 20 authorships.,I blame recruiters somewhat for this. As Data Scientist is a high demand field but also a fairly new term it's hard to find people with experience as a data scientist, because they were probably called something else before. So the recruiter searches for people with PhD in a scientific field because they tend to have all the core requisites and are easy to find.  ,Next thing you know all of the data scientists people have worked with have had PhDs so that starts to define what a DS is.,FWIW, this may be partially driven out of other data intensive AND interdisciplinary fields such as chem/bio informatics. In these fields, having a handle on all the necessary sub-disciplines requires long years of study and enough experience playing with data and programming to be competent enough to handle a dataset in some areas where results are taken very seriously.,You don't need a PhD to be a data scientist, in fact a lot of the PhDs Ive worked with have made poor data scientists because their solutions are too academic and aren't practically applicable. Data Scientists come in a bunch of different types, so don't discount yourself because you didn't get a PhD,Only going to speak generally since the other posts covered more specific definitions. I am always skeptical of the people I know who say they work with ""big data"" but are running processing locally on a laptop. In my field, even a 16 node cluster will get bottlenecked easily. At my last job, we had a 400 node cluster and petabytes of storage that was backed up daily,What were you using a 400 node cluster for? 
(Industry/Vertical if you don't want to get too specific),computational anatomy, primarily with biomedical imaging data (MRI, CT, all kinds), but others also did things with genetics data,I found that a lot of people who say ""big data"" can still run a handful of mysql tables on a single machine. Hell, my first DS job was with a company whose entire dataset fit comfortably in memory so I could around with it in Python.,More and more though, companies do have datasets the require Hadoop etc. Logging has just gotten easier, storage cheaper, and the tools to query​ faster.,""Big Data"" can be defined a couple different ways:,Many companies fit into the second definition, not as many fit into the first.,I'd say most companies have millions of rows of data, but I wouldn't call that big data. ,Agreed I think your parent comment fell into the classic trap of thinking their data is bigger than it is. ,If your entire corpus fits in memory it's not big data. ,I work for one of the core vendors in this space, from what I see the main problem in your question is that the definition of big data keeps getting bigger.,The biggest data by volume at the moment is machine data, usually measured in low 100's of TBs per day, but easily going into petabytes per day. This still runs into the problem of what is economically storable. Think Oil rig sensors, or all the network monitoring data at a small telco.,Big data can also be difficult data, for example some parts of the insurance industry only deals in low TBs per day but it's all very messy XML that needs to be shredded and analysed a hundred ways very quickly.,Velocity is a problem when you have billions of tiny messages that need to be analysed against other data to do things like detect fraud in banking transactions within a few hundred milliseconds - it's not by volume, but the geographic distribution of the inbound messages and the window for response puts it in a sister category.,So, perhaps it would be more useful to say that 'Big Data' is any data processing problem that doesn't fit in a single databases server  or laptop - what makes it bigger than those stalwarts is not always the same however.,I'd imagine that pretty much any large company/corporation, especially older ones, has at least 10s/100s of gigabytes if not terabytes worth of data.  If they have any efforts in an area like imagery, this can be vastly more.,That said, how much of that data is accessible or intended for any use beyond record keeping may be far less.  Their use cases will determine the systems/databases they need, and usually those systems aren't really ""big data"".,We have particular apps, tools, and analytics pipelines that do require pulling and processing data at scale, and in those cases we do use things like Hadoop, Spark, Cassandra, etc.,More like petabytes,Except all of it is virtually inaccessible. ,In the Enterprise Industrial IoT space, it's quite easy even for a simple PoC to get beyond a few million rows of data when you have sensors & gateway devices publishing frequently.  We've worked with several companies who have thousands of devices in the field reporting data back, but it's more likely that they're just getting started.  So, in our space I guess I'd say about 20 or 30% of companies I've seen already have what might be termed ""big data"" problems.. while the others aren't more than a few years behind and want to avoid issues as they roll out their solutions.,There are many things we've done with our IoT data management platform (,) to deal with the unique challenge of IoT data and it's use in applications, reports, ML models, etc...  but honestly I cringe at the improper use of 'big data' for IoT and those who Hadooop-up unnecessarily.,A lot of them have big data, but very few have questions you can answer with big data.,For example, I worked at a company with billion-row Redshift database.  I did a study where I looked at accuracy rates for record matching between peoples' names and phone numbers.  I couldn't use the billion rows because the only way to determine if a record was created accurately is to actually call the number and ask (or use voicemail) to figure it out.,Millions of rows but 30000 phone calls.  It became a ""small data"" problem.,Similarly, I was working on a team with a new product.  Over time it'll probably become big data, but when I left it was only about 500,000 rows because we didn't have that many subscribers.,I'd say very few companies have access to big data sets (100s of billions of rows) for practical use out side of Google, SAP, etc."
"Although many US data science bootcamps seek to recruit STEM majors and scientists with PhDs, the online information supplied seems very vague on this, offering no guidance, especially with regard to visas. The only one offering specific guidance ,, which offers this:,From searching, I haven't found any suitable examples, such as. The nearest that I can find is a , on a TN Visa, although he was an engineer beforehand.,And, as the Harvard Business Review notes, ,So is there any hope for someone with a PhD in science in doing a US data science bootcamp?,You're eligible for Insight with a TN.

"Captain here, its not a photo, its a gif,Is your masters giving you the project experience to meet all requirements on an average job posting? Can you get internships, maybe take some classes in the business school? That would be an ideal way to bridge the no work experience gap,The boot campus are an expensive way to get skills you can either get through a full degree program or through free online courses. An employer will care about your skills and what you can do,Thanks! I believe I can work on side projects on my own, and I'm been having trouble with looking for internships as I'm not based in the U.S., and there aren't limited opportunities where I'm based. The biggest draw of bootcamps for me is the employer connections (the job placement rates advertised by some of these programs look very enticing).,That unique situation makes you a good candidate for a bootcamp I guess, but I have no experience with them- don't take my word for it. I just get skeptical when you have to pay a lot, just do research and don't get sucked into a clever marketing plan. ,Alternatively, you could apply at an international consulting company, get experience, transfer countries within that company. But that's a longer term idea,I think if you want a more structured way to learn machine learning techniques/ python in data science maybe try a nano-degree from udacity? It's much cheaper, and the quality is OK. ,Thank you for the suggestion! The Data Analyst Nanodegree looks interesting! "

If you see any posts or comments violating these rules, please report them.,I've been a long time lurker of this subreddit and has helped me get through some tough parts of learning to program. I am currently focusing on changing my career to become a data scientist. I have gone back and forth on what would be best for my situation. Currently live at home with no expenses and have extensive time to study/ go to school if that would be best for me to become a data scientist.,Background:,Graduated from a University in California with a B.A. in Business Economics but before took 3 CS classes but didn't do as well due to time. Passed Econometrics and Multivariable Calculus classes. Have recently been working on learning Python, SQL, Databases, and Statistics.,Track 1: Finish a CS degree at Oregon State University (OSU) learning C++ and programming within a 1-2 Year timeframe.,Track 2: Learn Data Science Tools/Libraries and Python to later take a data science bootcamp and hopefully land a job thereafter.,My thoughts are that Track 1 is more safe since it would allow me to learn programming and branch off anyway I want from that. Although I am interested in Data Science currently and feel that my time would be better spent practicing by myself and come up with a capstone project.,Any advice would help. Thank you for listening!,TL DR: I want to become a data scientist but better to take it slow and learn the basics or just dive into the field and get some experience.,I'm not sure how you'd really sell yourself as a 'data scientist' who just took a bootcamp.,I was hoping that the bootcamp would be able to help me get a capstone project under my belt that would be good for my portfolio to potential employers ,[deleted],Sorry forgot to specify that OSU is Oregon State University which is reputable and seems like a great way to pursue another bachelor's in the field of computer science. What would you say are some reputable master's paths you've seen from fellow data scientists in your field?,I am working on projects aside from my studying to help get a thorough understanding of the concepts. Thanks for the advice!,[deleted],Thanks for letting me know!,I was thinking of just doing the CS program there but looking into the machine learning masters.,I went to osu! Something else to look at is their certificate or MBA in business analytics. Since you have a background in business it cuts out some classes and all of the business analytics courses are offered online! I took most of the classes but decided to take a break to learn python better. If you have a background in it already you'd do great and it's project based so you would end up with a capstone project from it. ,MBA courses there are expensive, but so are the post bacc fees (stupid, graduate school prices for undergrad classes). Good luck!,That sounds really interesting and thanks for the heads up. I'll look into the business analytics courses and see if that's up my alley. Do you think it would be better to get a better understanding of python and then take these courses?,Good to know that a capstone project will come from it.,All those fees are expensive but in the long run I think it would be worth it.,Appreciate it!,My knowledge of python before the course was basically zero, and those courses don't really start until the second term, so I think if you did a couple basic pre courses in something like Code school you would be fine. ,Are you unable to get a data analyst position with your current background? ,I know a guy with a similar background who did business analyst -> data analyst -> data scientist -> research scientist @ big4,I believe I would be suitable for a data analyst position but I would rather learn the skills and libraries needed to help me later on. ,That's awesome that he was able to advance through his job. Do you know how long it took him to reach those different job titles?,Might be easier to learn on the job tbh. I found that I learned more on the job as a data scientist in a month than self studying at home.,Are you able to do a master's in math, economics, statistics, data science, CS etc? It would be trivial to get a data analyst position after that. Much easier than bootcamp or second bachelor in CS. ,He did 2 years in corporate finance at a Fortune 500 (I think Disney) as a financial/business analyst and hated his life so he changed paths. Then he advanced from data analyst to data scientist to chief data scientist to director in 12 years at a fintech.  Then got poached by a big 4 after that. ,I feel the same way, at my previous job I found it easier to learn skills there rather than self studying. ,I am able to a master's in those subjects but don't really have the finances to pay for those and would need to take out a bunch of loans. ,That's a pretty awesome career path and to accomplish that in a reasonable amount of time. Looking into possible jobs around my area to get my into the field.,If you qualify, look into Georgia Tech's online masters. It's pretty cheap. ,Yeah he got pretty lucky considering he was one of the early ones that took a chance on data science. ,I'm approaching the halfway point through the 2 year OSU post-bacc program. My opinion on the program so far is that it is adequately rigorous. Having my first degree from UC Berkeley and taking a CS class there along with other technical classes, the difficulty and quality at OSU can't really compete, but that's to be expected given the fact that Berkeley is highly rated in CS. At OSU, some classes are really good, others are meh, but that's what you'd find at a typical university anywhere.,My goal like you is to transition to a software engineer / data scientist position but still be open to the possibility of grad school, and OSU's curriculum is helping me accomplish that. It's doable enough that I can hold a full time job at the same time (though sometimes it gets intense during crunch time), while fulfilling grad school requirements and getting exposure to the core areas of CS. ,As you probably know, a degree isn't needed to secure a job in the industry, but it helps you more easily get through the initial resume filtering that tends to happen. It's sometimes also hard to stay motivated to learn topics you don't immediately care about, some of which may involve core CS concepts, and the curriculum will force you to. No matter what road you choose, be sure to have a solid portfolio of side-projects and you can succeed.,How difficult do you find it to balance with with the online classes?,I'm not in Oregon State's program but I was admitted there and considered it, went with a MS program instead that offers most classes online. ,I took the first few prerequisite classes online when I was working and it was not bad, but I get way more out of classes when I'm actually there in person. OSU may be different, but here the online sections are just recordings of the on campus classes that aren't really optimized for viewing remotely, so the quality of the lectures can be hit and miss. ,The time management side of things is depends on how you study I guess, I was fine taking intro classes online while working but I don't think I'd want to take more intense classes remotely, it's easier to study when you have a physical class meeting instead of just a lecture video that you'll find time to watch eventually.,What are you pursing for a Masters? ,I am still contemplating whether or not I should do a Masters or a 2nd post- bacc. ,I personally prefer classes to be remote as I learn better that way. It's easier for me to get things done especially being out of state and love that I could go back and forth between video lectures. ,How far are you in your MS program?,I think it boils down to the actual class pairing. Some classes are more demanding than others, and if you take two of those classes at the same time, your time management skills will be put to the test, and it can feel like all you do is eat, sleep, breathe, and code. If that's sounds like something you can manage, than you will be fine. During my busiest quarter with a demanding pairing, I had to use PTO days at work to find time to finish assignments. My other quarters haven't been nearly as involved. So if you attend OSU, try to plan smart, and I'd say don't be aftaid to space classes out over an extra quarter if needed.,What do you think that I would better be off doing a Master's degree in say Statistics rather than going back and getting a 2nd Post - bacc degree for CS at OSU? ,Good luck to you on that transition and I would say that if you can finish and possible do grad school it seems more beneficial. That's great to hear you are holding a full time job and doing school, really motivated! ,That's my concern about the degree to secure a job. I see that there are some people who have made it without a degree but having it seems to open up some doors as well. I am currently trying to stay motivated and work on some side-projects to help build a portfolio for employers but still in the learning phase right now.,Best of luck to you and great username lol!,Thanks lol. To answer your question, I would say it depends on what you actually enjoy doing more - do you prefer to write software + scripts, or do you prefer actually crunching the numbers + doing the mathematical analysis? If you look at almost any data science job description, they tend to list a pre-req as ""MS in computer science, machine learning, statistics, or related discipline."" So there are multiple avenues to a data science position, and once you get there, you'll likely learn a lot about what you didnt choose to get a masters in on the job. So pick what you see yourself enjoying more, and perhaps try to get coursework and/or experience in what you feel you might be lacking.,What do you mean by data scientist? Titles like scientist, engineer, doctor, technologist, etc are protected. You can't self-teach your way to those titles. ,If you share what you want the content of your job to be, perhaps we can help you from that angle. If you want the scientist title, you will need at least a degree. You can challenge these things sometimes, but the process isn't easy and people rarely achieve it. ,Wow that's something I didn't expect. I was hoping that from working my way up from a data analyst I can be later become a data scientist for an aerospace company helping broker airplane/helicopter parts since the industry is lacking in technology.,I don't know if you need to be a scientist if your desired career path is a purchaser! ,But yes, there are clearly defined steps you have to go through if you want to claim titles like those. To know what they are, and what the challenge options are, you'll have to look up the governing body in your region. ,*Any experience in the type of work or industry of work you desire is a good thing though, just wanted to be clear about that. ,I would like to become a data scientist and that was just one path that I thought I could help improve since I already had some experience, but if there is a better opportunity I sure would take it.,In this case I think your best bet is aiming for jobs you can get now that will give you exposure to the jobs you think you want. That will help you get a good idea of them and figure out which role* you want. You can find these by going to the websites of companies that interest you and checking out what their job openings are. And/or submit your resume to a recruiter that works in that industry. ,Then you can look up requirements for the role you find most interesting. It's easy to do, just search for job ads. Read the requirements. Ones you don't have you look up what you need to get them. That's what will lead you to what you should do now. ,In your spare time you could start with sql, calculus, and maybe boolean logic. ,Thanks for helping me and will definitely look up some requirements for roles in companies I am interested. I'll work on learning SQL and other skills related to those jobs. The math portion I feel I have a good understanding of but wouldn't hurt to go over them once more. Appreciate your feedback.,no problem! I hope it goes very well,What's OSU? Oregon, Ohio?,Also, what do you see yourself doing as a data scientist? Data science is very math heavy, and it often requires working on large scale problems... I'd say it's pretty hard to teach yourself, and I'm not sure there are bootcamps are a legitimate option there.,If I were you and I had the chance to study a masters at a university, I'd do that.,OSU = Oregon State University.,I would want to work data sets to help solve business problems but haven't really chosen a specific field of study. I will make it my focus this week to narrow down what I would want as a data scientist. ,I do have that opportunity and have been contemplating that for a while. Do you think I would be better off getting a second B.A. in CS and then pursue a Masters? ,Forgetting something?,What did I forget? ,Oklahoma State,If you want to be a data scientist and decide to go back to school, why not get a statistics degree? CS degrees and data science careers have minimal overlap compared to statistics degrees and data science careers.,If you want to self study, I'd say teach yourself R and start with Hadley Wickham's books - ,I haven't ruled out a Masters  in Statistics degree. I feel that I have seen most data scientists come from this background and excel. I just felt I needed to improve my coding first.,Thanks for the link I will definitely take a look and try and understand R after these python MOOC's I am taking.,Try landing an entry position as a credit risk/operational risk/marketing analyst at a bank. That will give you provide you with both income and experience. Initially you won't be doing the cool data science stuff, but you will be able to meet the people who are. Show a bit of interest and  you might get to work on some cool projects.,That sounds like a really good job experience! Thanks for letting me know. I am still deciding whether a I should take a data science job or just keep on with my studying.,It would be nice to get some cool projects under my belt though.,If you're funding your studying through debt, it's almost always better to get a job and continue studying part-time. After a while, experience, ability and the networks you develop will count more than academic qualifications.,That's a good point. You don't think the benefits of finishing a post-bacc degree that would cost approximately $20k in 1-2 years that could open doors to a job that is around $75k is better than work part-time/ study part time?,1-2 years of living expenses versus 3-4 years of income less living expenses. The difference in starting salary for the additional qualification given no experience is really small compared to no experience vs 2 year's experience."

I did a 3 month data science bootcamp, followed by a longer data science bootcamp. Then I interned 2 months doing computer vision. Followed by a 5 month job as a data scientist. ,My job ended a few months ago and I am having trouble finding a new one. I feel stuck in between two fields. Because although I can code in Python and a bit of C++/C and assembly. I don't have the CS background and am missing some fundamentals such as OOP, operating systems, and algorithms. I also roughly understand the machine learning, but not enough to compete with most data scientists that have a higher degree.,So I was basically thinking to go back to school and get a masters in cs, either at a city college (10k) or NYU Tandon (60k). That way i can take 1, 1.5 years to learn all the cs i missed. I'm just so worried that I'll come out of my masters and still not be able to find a job. Or I can just keep brushing up on interviewing questions with sites such as leetcode, take online classes on MIT, land a job and continue to learn on my own while working. What would you guys suggest?,Data science is a new field so the interview/job finding process isn't as standardized so I would guess most people here will suggest you to get a masters.,That said, masters don't always translate to better job opportunities.  I would suggest you directly ask any program you're going into what their job placement statistics are.  ,Yea the process is definitely less standardized and the interview questions vary widely. That's a good suggestion, I will ask. Thanks,Data science is a very new field, it has huge potential but currently only bigger companies seem to utilize it. It draws from so many aspects that candidates without masters / phd are often lacking in certain areas as a data scientist. ,You do have master degrees that are tailored around data science though and it'll also involve much programming. Data science has very broad applications to research as well which makes it a very useful tool to master whenever you're doing quantitative or even qualitative research for a phd or paper. ,If I were you I would evaluate what you'd really want. Regardless of what master you chose it will likely be difficult (which means doing a job along with it is difficult due to time / stress constaints). On the other hand you have a degree in math and programming experience so you can very likely sell yourself to another well paying less specific job in the IT sector. ,Yes some related jobs are either data analyst or data engineering which I am aiming for now to no avail. If I did a masters I would focus more on CS than Data Science as I think that CS is much more fundamental to most Data Science jobs, with only the really top Data Science jobs geared towards researchers in the field.,You've already done two data science bootcamps, why would you get a masters? If you're passionate about data science, learn R, SAS, SQL, and data visualization. Apply to entry level data science jobs (even if they don't pay as well - better than getting into debt from school), get the experience, and move on to higher paying data science positions after a year. Boom. ,b/c boot camps don't get you jobs in a field in which a PhD reigns supreme.... IMO a BA in Math isn't enough. Which is why I'm impressed OP found a job prior. ,Stil have the job available contingent upon moving back to that country. And yes definitely agree with you,Even entry level jobs are highly competitive with people that have higher degrees,Data science positions have leaned heavily in favor of candidates with PhDs, strong research backgrounds, and/or specific domain knowledge.

I enjoy teaching, and they pay comparable to what I'm seeing in industry, but I worry that taking this will not expand, or maybe even limit, my career options in the future.,I have a few internships to my name, but do not have extensive industry experience. Will a period teaching here ""count"" towards years of experience applying to jobs? Or will I be considered in more or less the same position seniority-wise as I am now?,On the other hand, I see the ""pros"" to the position being networking and rounding out my knowledge of the field, and it certainly sounds better than deferring my graduation for another quarter if my other interviews don't work out.,Thoughts? Thanks in advance!,It's really good for networking and looks better than being unemployed on a resume, but it's definitely not as valuable as real experience. The reason being that the bootcamp repeats itself every 3 months so you don't learn anything new the second time around. After a year you'll have 3 months of experience repeated 4 times, not a year of experience."

You won't be able to vote or comment.,According to a recent survey by EMC, 9% of Data Science professionals have a Doctoral Degree, 31% have a Master’s Degree and 27% an Undergraduate Degree. This rather blows out of the water the myth that all Data Scientists have to have a Ph.D.,Over the next five years, 63% of relevant organizations believe that demand for talent will outstrip supply. So, where are these professionals going to come from? As a Data Science recruiter, I would like to outline four of the main routes into the industry.,It ‘s true to say that the leading Data Science professionals are frighteningly intelligent Ph.D qualified Masters of the Universe. They have been at the cutting edge of this fast developing industry for the last few years. They have increasingly large and complex teams around them, many of whom have done Masters in Data Science or Computing, but as the years go by yet more are entering the industry from other routes. Vast increases in technology are opening up Data Science to a wider audience.,Here are four options if you don’t have (or want) a Ph.D.,Undergraduate Degree + Experience (Standard),You might have a degree in Statistics, Mathematics or Computer Sciences, but depending on which of the four Data Science verticals that you will be working in (Data Businesspeople, Data Creatives, Data Developers or Data Researchers), a business degree or MBA may also be a route to entry. This is often enough for entry level Data Science roles depending on your background and experience. However, many prefer one of the following three options in addition.,MOOC Data Science Courses: 6-18 months part time, Free – $1k,There are good quality specialized courses for a broad appreciation of the subject, and they are providing a route into the industry. For example, the Johns Hopkins University “Data Science” course can be found on Coursera. It is difficult to juggle a job with regular classes, and you miss the interactive collaboration with other students, but it is a low-cost and low-risk option with minimum disruption to the current career.,Data Science Bootcamp: 2-3 months, $1k-$14k,Bootcamps base their learning around completing practical projects with other students, whilst also learning the theoretical background. There is the same collaboration and teamwork aspect as with a Master’s Degree, but for a fraction of the price. This is sometimes the preferred route into Data Science for Senior Management level professionals.,Master’s Degree: 9-20 months, $20k-$70k,A Data Science Master’s Degree is the preferred route into the industry, although it is far from essential. It offers an excellent theoretical background plus good amounts of practical experience over an extended period.,It is important to remember that the current leaders within Data Science have “learnt on the job.” They have created an entirely new industry and although “Data Scientist” is a rather vague title, to work in an ever technologically led industry does not require years of scientific research under your belt.,A good theoretical background from a quality MOOC, Bootcamp or ideally Master’s degree, plus a few years of practical experience will set you well on your way.,Thank you. This was useful."
"However, when I applied to various bootcamps and certificate programs, I found a dearth of information for each one.

"I am 27 years old, and I was diagnosed with 'language processing disorder' (expressive and receptive) since I was in preschool/elementary school (don't remember).,
English is my native language and it is not as good as others with English as second language.  ,I currently don't have much of friends, never have a girlfriend or on a date.  But it is not my concern for now.  ,My main concern now is to improve and get back with what adults do.  Instead of being left behind on elementary/middle school level.,I graduated with BS Electrical Engineering Degree.,
I am now unemployed and planning to go to Data Science bootcamp for next winter if i get accepted.,I read people advice saying 'Be confident', 'be positive, 'you are being negative', 'just talk to people', ' don't make excuses' etc, but it seems it have not helping me much for years.  So I will try and go into detail.,I am now struggling to improve my reading, writing, talking, and learning skills.  My vocabulary usage is limited.  It is suppose to be learned in elementary school.  ,Reading:
When I read a book, articles, whether the subject is interesting or not,  i easily get bored and exhausted, and cannot learn or remember anything I read.  Same for audiobooks as well.  I'm also struggling to improve my reading comprehension.  I also have to constantly check the dictionary if i don't know what vocabulary is.  The worst case is that even I check dictionary, I still don't understand it.  I have to ask someone on what the dictionary means.,Writing and talking are also my struggles I'm facing.  My social skills needs alot of improvement.  If i get questions i need to answer (whether it is easy question or not), I cannot answer it right away.  It'll take me time to process and think about what i should say.  Same thing as writing as I'm doing now in this post.  Most of the time, I check examples on how people respond so I can just use them as reference.  ,For learning, it seems I need help on improving learning habits/skills.  I have to work harder as others ( start early, use more time on it) .  Instead of understanding, all I can do is copy what others do in tutorials/ people getting good grades/my father.  If someone ask me why am I doing this/that, I will say because that's how they did it(means I will say I don't know, i just follow what they did).  I couldn't explain, so I just show a video to them so that they can understand better.,
Asking for help is a skill I need improvements as well as people don't understand what I want. ,I am now seeing a therapist, and all he saying is i just have to practice, but I need to know how.  He ask me what do I want, and I told him, ""I don't know what I want."" ,I am trying to find a Speech Language Pathologist Therapy, but it's very difficult to find as it's pretty rare for adults.  They also don't cover my free health insurance.  ,Right now, I'm living with my parents.  My mother is about to retire in maybe a few years.  My father main concern now is worry about me on how to handle life since my level is not what adults do.,I understand that there is no shortcut and that it'll take me time to practice, but obviously my main problem is I don't know what i'm doing.  ,P.S. It took me time to write this, and I'm sorry if my writing doesn't make sense. Please ask me questions so I can do my best to answer or if I'm missing something.,Thanks,Cant offer much advice but can tell you that you wrote this post beautifully. It might have taken a while but you did a solid job of conveying your message. Good luck.,Even though you have to work harder than others, you can still improve.  Like your therapist said, the only way to improve is to practice. It's ok if you don't finish the books you start, the point is to practice reading. Read very slow and think about what the sentence means. Don't try to read too fast, go at the pace where you can understand the material. Eventually, you'll get faster.,You might never get to the reading level of many adults, but that is OK. We all have weaknesses. Try not to compare your skills to others and focus on yourself. The only thing that matters is that YOU improve and be the best possible version of yourself.,One app that has improved my writing and reading skills is Grammerly. It points out where you went wrong in your writing and gives suggestions on how to fix it. It can fix anything you wrote on the internet, like in your emails. Making mistakes and learning to fix them is an excellent way to learn. ,I also read Grammerly's blog posts that give tips on better writing. Their blog is a good place for you to practice reading because their writing is clear and concise.

Welcome to Reddit.,demon_merman gave some great advice when he said ""We all have weaknesses. Try not to compare your skills to others and focus on yourself. The only thing that matters is that YOU improve and be the best possible version of yourself."" That's 100% correct.,You mentioned you don't enjoy/have difficulty learning via books and audiobooks. How about YouTube videos? Everyone has a different learning style and some people prefer to learn via videos. Watching YouTube videos might be a more fun way for you to learn.  ,I would advise picking subjects you like because they will be more fun to learn and you are likely to try harder, focus more and not give up so easily.,I would advise joining Toastmasters too, because that will not only help you to meet people, but it will allow you to improve upon your public speaking skills, and in my experience, the better your public speaking skills are, the easier every other form of communication is.,What are your favorite subjects? What gives you the most pleasure and fun in life? ,Hi,
Thank you for the suggestions.,
Yes, I'm trying not to compare myself to others, but i'll add more to see if it helps.,
Yes, I already have been doing YouTube videos for years.  It helps me a bit for learning because I can just rewind back many times on what the person says. ,The main reason for reading books and learning audiobooks is because I'm been told that it's the only way to improve english skills.    It is also required if I need not only for employment but in everyday lives such as dealing with medical agreements, courts, etc.  ,Unfornuately, I don't have any favorite subjects that I want.  And I don't know what gives me the pleasure and fun even though I go outside and explore.,
I guess I could say that I lack self-discipline(not sure if that is the right word), which I think it is also my big problem for me now, not only english.  And that could be why I get bored and exhausted.,Have you ever tried listening to an audiobook while following along with a printed book? I've done that with text that bored me but that I still needed to read and it forced me to stay on track. It might help you associate the spelling and pronunciation of certain words. You could even practice reading aloud with the audiobook voice to get more comfortable with speaking in complete sentences.,By the way, I felt like you explained yourself very well and it seems like you have good potential.

,  ,Let's play a game.  I tell you what I do for a living and you tell me what my title is.  ,My background is in E-Commerce and I went to school for Economics and Stats.  I've worked for my current employer, a small/medium-sized tech company, for a little over 2 years now where I was hired as a Data Analyst.  A few months before I started here, I finished a coding bootcamp course in Data Science where I started writing in Python.  When I started my current job, I expected to write some SQL, look at numbers, do some math, and tell people who made more money than me what to do about said math.  ,Over the first 3-6 months of my job, I took over the grunt work for a reporting engineering deptartment that was dissolved prior to a company re-org.  This included maintaining and optimizing ,; ingesting files from emails and data from APIs, parsing data with ,, and writing to , databases.  ,I inherited this system and for the first 3-6 months, the question I was usually asked was ""where is my data?"".  Over this time I made it a point to make sure no one had any reason to ask me that anymore.  ,Months 6-12 included me flying abroad to develop a solution for a newly acquired startup in another country.  Their database was an Excel sheet, so I set out to build a similar infrastructure for them.  Excel was a key tool for them, so this included learning , to integrate their current workflow into the system I built, which this time leveraged , services, which my company had just begun using.  I set up , - only using Python to handle dataflow.  ,Months 12-18 was like going back to a marriage right after your first affair.  The processes I had established were pretty airtight and perhaps because the company was growing, there was less pivoting.  With less pivoting came less technical surprises.  It became maintenance from here until the next few months when I started getting back into analysis.  With no systems to worry about, I got to do some , and a little bit of modeling.  Exploratory data analysis became a huge part of my focus.  With this, I became more involved in the process of displaying data.  Enter: ,.  I built a few standalone apps with Flask, tweaked some legacy apps built in PHP, and contributed to some projects built in Node.  Through this I also became a bit more savvy with web servers.

What in the heck am I?  ,I went to school for Economics, and have no formal training in CS or IT.  I feel like I've gone in so many directions that I'm worried about landing another position if I decide to move to another company.  I understand that the REAL answer here is ""it's up to you"", but for the sake of an attempt to have a more precise career outlook, if you had to give it a name, what would you call my role during the last 2 years of my career?  ,Man if I were you, I would sell myself as an Infra guy. Selling yourself as a data scientist is just going to pigeonhole you into a certain type of role.,Yeah, that's a great point.  Everyone will always need infra, but DS I'm finding is always evolving and what's hot now gets cold real quick (relatively).  ,Also everyone wants to do DS and (relatively) no one wants to do infra which (everything is relative) relatively makes infra more valuable I suppose :),I work as a data engineer, close to data science, and you're probably a CTO/Director in the making; i.e., you're doing an incredible amount of work, likely getting paid too little, and you'll move on to greener pastures when you realize your employer isn't paying you enough. Also, yes, you've done analytics but what you're describing as ""data science"" is better labeled data analyst work, unless you've got machine learning or heavy statistics work hidden in there.,You might hate this answer, but it's true: you can probably do anything between DevOps/Sys Admin, backend, data engineering, data analytics, or data science, or shift into a managerial-but-technical role, like Director of Data or something similar. AKA it looks like you can shift into any role you want, it just depends on how you tell your story. I suggest you write out your resume description with the stories that are relevant to what you want to do next, not load everything in there. AKA if you want to be a Data Engineer, put SQL/anything Hadoop/Spark/data integration tasks as what you do then start interviewing. ,For example, my job titles so far have been Oracle DBA > ETL ""dev"" > Data Engineer. In between 2 and 3 I re-wrote my job descriptions to better focus on what I liked doing, which was data engineering: data integration + programming, like Spark. ,Side note and out of curiosity, care to share what you're building in this line?,This is really encouraging, thanks for replying :),You're right, I'm not as happy with not being able to do the type of heavy stats work a data scientist would do, and part of me is concerned about falling behind in what's cutting-edge or at least close to it.  Another part of me justifies that though by saying that what's ""hot"" (or just new) now are technologies like self-driving cars, and not so much the recommendation systems and fraud detection systems I was excited to work on back when I first got into all this.  That said, in retrospect I'm glad to have seen if not just a glimpse of what building any kind of ML model would take from the infra-perspective.,Re: that library I'm building out:,The analysts on my team hit a bunch of different APIs and databases (by proprietary tech I mostly meant this) for reporting purposes.  They manipulate data and combine from any combination of the different sources.  Then they ship via any method from email to S3.  ,The processes we now maintain over the course of years of these tasks having accumulated are maintained all via cron, and script templates that have been mutated over time from people copy/pasting functions to adding their own, and troubleshooting/maintenance is like a different adventure every time.,On top of everything, there isn't much by way of monitoring/alerting when something goes wrong, outside of a bi-daily email that sends out to the greater team with a list of N jobs that errored out.,I'm working on packaging all the tools in our analysts' workflow up so that an analyst having to spend time scripting out something like,Can become an analyst doing something like this:,More important than leaner scripting, a lot of the gain here is meant to be added validation, error handling, and monitoring, which is all built into these modules.  I'm also writing this in Python 3 (where all processes are currently run in Python 2), as well as building in AWS (where we currently use AWS for only a portion of our auxiliary servers.  I'm hoping to have a UI in the future to sit on top of this stuff so that analyst scripting will be a thing of the past, but one of the things I haven't taken the time to learn is front-end - mainly because I don't like it tbh, but also I work with front-end devs who do great work already.,Glad to talk more about this in detail but not in an open thread :),Data Scientist, no contest. Pretty sure you used the word data in every other sentence."
"What are you looking to get out it and what are you trying to accomplish?,Also, I personally consider sql and at least some kind of analysis be it r or python to be critical for web analytics unless we are just talking using aggregated google analytics or took data,I'm looking to do more 'heavy lifting.' My work thus far has been usually tied to the use of Google Analytics and similar tools. "
"I would say stick with the PhD. Make your thesis more computational and that will help you land bioinformatics/comp bio jobs. While working I would do bootcamps/workshops/self learning to better computational skills. Get a cs degree if u feel the need but IMO you can switch to cs jobs from bioinformatics jobs with the right skill set. ,Thank you!!,See my post ,.  Other bits of advice:,Thanks for the advice, I really needed this! 
On the second point, I have another question--I'm not entirely sure if I want to end up doing something in biology. I was just thinking about bioinformatics and computational biology because I didn't want my graduate degree to go to waste, for the lack of a better term. Considering that I may work in a nonbiological field, do you think it's worth it for me to finish with a PhD, since it still shows that I had what it takes to earn one? Thanks again.,Dunno, that's a decision that you have to make.  I've chuckled more than once that I have degrees in Biology and History, but am working in Informatics/Computer Science.  That being said, the BA in history gave me a foundation in , to research, the BS in Biology gave me the groundwork I'd need for Scientific fields, and the PhD in Biology gave me critical insight into Life and Physical Science research, which made me invaluable as collaborator for multiple fields.  ,None of the degrees I have are a waste, but were gained when I was still trying to figure out what I wanted to do.  Had I known what I wanted to do earlier in my career, there were other, easier paths that I could have taken to accomplish the same goal, but that is hindsight for you, and who knows what would have happened if I would have made a particular, different decision.,The best additional advice that I can give is to have a concrete, specific plan (""I'm going to do Bioinformatics in a lab"" is not a plan), with carefully weighed costs at every step of the way.  It's ok for the plan to change, as long as an understanding of the associated costs and the underlying goal remain.  For example, if your long term goal is to work as a Bioinformatician in a University Lab, do the research, and figure out in 5 years how much a PhD will increase your salary as opposed to a MS.  Also investigate how many Bioinformaticians have a Biology BS degree to determine how much that will affect your salary.  If this is in line with what you want, great!  If not, you need to rethink and remake your plans.,Get an MS then apply for bioinformatic PhD programs maybe? ,Thank you! Would you say that entering that field is something I can do with a biology degree augmented by thesis work/skills, or is a bioinformatics degree absolutely necessary? When I was looking up job listings, a lot said that a degree in ""bioinformatics, or related field"" was necessary. If the skills are there, would biology degree suffice as a 'related field'? Thanks so much.,Having started, I'd finish the PhD, but try to steer it in the right direction in any way you can manage - get as much experience along the way as you can. Some labs specifically recruit for wet/dry-lab people, so you may actually gain an advantage for certain jobs ... and even if they're not, don't underestimate the benefit of knowing what wet-lab work entails when designing and implementing an appropriate analysis!  A person with a purely CompSci background doesn't have this advantage and it's recognised by lab heads.,Continue with your python for the higher level stuff, but extensive familiarity with *nix systems is almost more important.  Your day to day work will be in the terminal and you need pretty decent knowledge of system administration for a surprising number of tasks.,I got my entry level job with a bio degree. I have a CS certificate which is essentially a beefed up minor. Honestly degree wasn't really talked about much. In my interviews it aS based on my code knowledge, github and relevant experience professional and academic. ,Can you switch your major, perhaps to an interdisciplinary one where you can stay in your department, like quantitative biosciences, computational biology, etc? How about picking some computational profs to be on your committee? I audited a CS class this semester and the professor asked if I would like to add him to my committee after talking to him at the end of the first week of class because he really liked my project. My adviser recently offered to fund a masters program in CS after a chemistry PhD student defended, the student had already taken half the courses for MS in CS during his PhD degree so it would have only been one or two semesters.,If you're already 2 years into a PhD, and expect you can finish in a couple of years, stick with that. As other people have mentioned, you can add some more bioinformatics exploration to your project and get your feet dry, while coming out the other end with a PhD as well."

The nanodegree would not give as much credibility, but it would be more practical, cheaper, and it wouldn't take nearly as long.

I feel like I've gone in so many directions that I'm worried about landing another position if I decide to move to another company.  I understand that the REAL answer here is ""it's up to you"", but for the sake of an attempt to have a more precise career outlook, if you had to give it a name, what would you call my role during the last 2 years of my career?  ,You're more of a Dev if you ask me. In my current project, there's a Dev team and in that Dev team there's an enhancement team and it does the same stuff that you did. Enhancing, coming up with solutions to existing problems in the scope of programming. But apart from that you do have a lot of other stuff so I guess you can sell yourself as Jack of all trades. "
Looking forward to hearing from y'all!
"Good idea! I really need to learn how to meditate haha.,Off topic: what compelled you to data science and coding? ,I really enjoy solving problems and creating a huge impact in the world we live in. It brings value to the work that I put using my passion for mathematics and my excitement to envision approaches to drive for solutions. (:,For me, it's meditating and learning to make fun of my impatience.  ,I love that idea.

Just came back from a small piano break :D,Oooooo yes, I supposed I do crafting breaks too! I'm bad at instruments :D"
"Could I get some recommendations for laptops (or concerns about my partition plan)? I'm hoping to use the Black Friday sales to score a good deal. I've been told to look for 8 GB of RAM, 1 TB of disk space. Thanks.,My recommendation would be to grab a used ThinkPad from eBay (~$200) and upgrade it with a fresh battery, extra memory, and maybe a SSD.,I recently wanted a dedicated laptop to do DS like things on. I ended up buying a 13"" Lenovo x220 on ebay. I bought a machine with no hard drive or power supply and purchased those separately also on ebay. For about $250 total I got a like-new laptop with 8GB of RAM, recent gen i5, and a latest gen 128GB SSD (with a second drive bay as well). I run xubuntu on it and it's super speedy, plus i cannot tell you how much I have learned about linux and scripting. linux is not as bad as it used to be, plus there is a LOT of support for linux on thinkpads (,). ,I know you may be looking for a larger desktop replacement and may prefer to stay windows-only, but figured i would mention it as a solid cheap/alternative option. i was previously windows-only as well. ,I'm currently using a desktop, but would be going across the country and trying to minimize the amount of stuff I'm going to bring, so it would be my sole computer- work and personal. I hadn't thought about buying pieces of a laptop separately.,Since, you mention BF sales/deals, I would recommend HP. Narrow down your options based on a few deals and check with HP over phone or chat on their website if the model you wish to buy is fully supported for Ubuntu. If yes, go with the one you chose. They also match the price or at least that's what they say. Usually touch screens or 2-in-1 s are not fully supported. HPs are linux friendly and dual-boot wont void the warranty. In my experience HPs are friendly towards virtualization etc. Warranty is not void with Lenovos too when you dual boot. Good luck.,Depending on the bootcamp, you may find that there is a non-trivial amount of friction using a non-standard system whether that is installation of software/packages or pair programming.  In the Galvanize program, those without Macs tend to jump through a few more hoops than the rest of us.  ,BTW, I was a PC person before the program, but have converted.,It is Galvanize. If it were only for work, I might switch, but I will be using it as my personal computer and I don't want to pay the Mac tax. I'd rather learn Linux, as it seems more helpful.,Yeah, for the most part, if it's just Python or R, Linux and OS X are pretty much the same.,Unless you need to run Hadoop, you'll be fine with Windows in 99% cases.

" and maybe some other online courses.,Will I even get invited to job interviews or is this all just a joke to recruiters.
I would also like to build a little portfolio.,I dropped out of university years ago to pursue an entrepreneurial endeavour which went quite well, however now Im (27) and am looking for something new.,Idk what others think, but I think ANY bachelors degree is important for these types of jobs,Yes and no... As a hiring manager it's a huge plus when people post projects online and I generally ask them to walk me through their favorite one. The problem you'll have is getting your information to people like me. A lot then depends on your background and prior work experience. I'm not really a fan of the 12-week bootcamps unless you are coming in with a strong quantitative background (and in that case is it really necessary?). There's a reason this is posted in the one you linked: ,Probably the simplest way of looking at this:  Most large companies HR people don't want to take a risk on someone without a degree.  If someone has a degree and is terrible, it can be chalked up to the person not being a good fit / able to talk their way through the interviews / etc.,If they hire someone without a degree, they better be CERTAIN they will get the job done, else they might be out the door themselves.,Full Disclosure: I'm Udacity's Web Dev Curriculum Director.,As many others in this thread have mentioned - projects are really what they are looking for. They want , you have skills, know what you are talking about, and will be influential.,The greatest challenge in not having a degree, is getting noticed by the recruiters/hiring managers. Thankfully, as part of your Nanodegree program you have direct access to our Careers VP and we've had considerable success in placing graduates in positions. For all intents and purposes, in job descriptions - the degree prerequisite is just there to ""thin out the crowd"". Most recruiters/hiring managers receive tons of applicants that are nowhere near qualified for the position, so this is just one way in which they try to preemptively thin out that crowd.,Unofficial, my own opinion: It's not Data Science, but I've been a Web Developer for over 16 years - I have no college degree (I went to FSU for 3 days). I've hired dozens of developers - your credentials, GPA, school name, etc. mean absolutely nothing to me. When I see your resume, I'm going to Google you and look at your blog, GitHub, LinkedIn, personal projects. If you have projects out there that interest me and are indicative of your skillset, I'm interested.,The most disappointing interview I ever did in my life was with a NASA scientist. The most interesting, an Intuit engineer that decided she was more interested in teaching kids to program.,Thanks for the response, that gives hope to follow it through.,I don't know but I am wondering the same.  Is it worth it to drop a bunch of cash on a degree?,Na mayne i dudnt go n look @ me nao.,But seriously you don't have to drop a bunch of cash if you take prereq at CC then go to a state school or something. And yes it is worth it. You'll make on avg 1 million more in your lifetime with a bachelors degree.,Companies will look at someone who has a BS and MS much more favorably. And you wouldn't even learn enough from that to be qualified for a job in the first place."
"I have been studying on my own and applying, and while I have gotten on site interviews with places nothing has stuck so far.  That is part of the reason I was thinking of the bootcamp route.,Thanks ,Hey man, I've been thinking about this too! I'm on the same path as you (studying data science on my own, getting lot of interviews, but not many are working out). Let me know if you find any info!,Well, I can say that data incubator had the most unprofessional interview process and I can't really recommend them. Insight was much more straightforward and a much more professional experience so I sent with them. Startup.ml also sounded interesting and I had some good conversations with them, but the program is 4 months long which seemed a bit on the ongoing side. If I was just starting in my studying they would be a good fit. More actual data science instruction. ,Hey man! Thanks for getting back to me with your experience. Congrats on getting into the insight program! "
"Everyone here has been a big help in making a recent transition from a PhD in computational chemistry into an almost data scientist.  I just want to ask the community for their thoughts on my current situation with respect to career development.  ,The main question is how transferable would skills developed in an ""analyst"" role at a digital advertising company using R, SQL and cloud computing be to other data science roles in other industries. Would accepting such a position pigeon hole me for future positions as a data scientist or would it open-doors in other fields besides advertising in the future?,The secondary question is less direct and just a matter of asking for other peoples sentiments or personal stories.  I have a job offer for a Senior Analyst position in a well known but medium sized digital advertising agency.  This will be my first job and I want to be sure it is the best opportunity for my future.  I should mention I finished my degree 6 days ago.  Besides the offer, I have an interview in two weeks for a junior data science position at an insurance company and a deposit down for a data science bootcamp in NYC.  The latter was done prior to getting any interviews as a backup and because I am not 100% confident in my skills I have developed and wanted more guided instructions before entering the job market. What is most important to me is what I do next prepares me for a long exciting and dynamic career 5 -10 years from now.  Two additional mentions which I am lucky to work off of - money is currently not a problem nor priority and I will live almost anywhere.  ,Any advice would be useful feel free to pm me too.,Thanks again everyone,It's your first job, just pick something. You're not going to pigeon hole yourself, its not going to force you into an industry,  just get some experience, somewhere, anywhere, and you'll figure it out from there. You don't need to have everything figured out now, you're probably going to change fields a bunch of times anyway. A ""5 to 10 year dynamic career""  is going to take more than one job, don't sweat it, pick something that you find interesting. ,Do the boot camp and get placed at an awesome company that knows the value of data science.  Agencies could be a mess with poor data and an opportunity cost in terms of how fast you'd learn. ,Roles in digital don't translate that well to 'data science', however they still translate to some very good jobs in analytics. This field is a lore more business focused that data science, which is very tech focused.,id take the insurance job man, digital world is full of doofuses and dumb fucks. you will be pissed having to answer to people who have marketing degrees who are beyond fucking stupid..you will even start to respect liberal arts majors after dealing w/ these people "
"I am asking b/c this bootcamp is ranked #3 in top DS bootcamps in USA and they have a partime online bootcamp.  Other bootcamps are F2F classrooms for 3 months which means I have to resign or take a sabbatical from my job.  I have a phobia of being unemployed so online bootcamp (4 to 6 months) is attractive.  , ,This report was clearly compiled by someone who is not a data scientist. The ranking is simply an aggregation of bootcamps with high student reviews and reflects nothing on the quality of the curriculum or career placement data.,Everyone in the industry knows , is the best, however, they should not be considered a true bootcamp as they only take PhDs and its more fitting to call it a ""fellowship program."",Those ranking are pretty arbitrary. You should check in with a handful of them that are near you and get a feel from the atmosphere if you're planning on FtF. For online just start learning, they're all pretty cheap and you get what you pay for but could be nice for getting your feet wet.,I checked them out a few years ago and my instinct is to advise against it. ,Try and talk to some of the alumni - I did that and found their stories to be less than what I was hoping for. ,That is what OP is trying to do through this post!,Kinda to build off this. It's just hard to 'sell' a bootcamp as credentials. I think try to find the lowest cost bootcamp to get the knowledge and then make sure you're building a portfolio to help demonstrate how your skills will apply to the job. ,Hi Saul, why do u say bootcamps are hard to sell as credentials?  Have you talked to bootcamp grads? Also were you or your company ever been involved in recruiting bootcamp grads?  ,I say that because it's my opinion that hiring manager asking for 'x' years of experience are not going to be inclined to hire someone with 'x' weeks of experience. Now this doesn't mean that people from boot camp don't get hired. I'm trying to get across that boot camps are not a silver bullet to employment issues. ,Thank you for your response Saul.  I think the reason why US has a tech worker crisis is that the hiring managers and their HR partners are way too picky.  They want candidates with tons of years xp but they are not willing to give people straight out of bootcamp/grad school a chance.  So they hire H1B candidates from India but Trump will put a stop to that.  I am not trying to be political here but it would be interesting if hiring managers are forced to hire and train not completely qualified US workers and develop them.   "
"[deleted],On the flipside, a lot of people don't go directly into the field they studied. It's less likely when you come from a STEM background, but even in my CS class only around half of us went into straight-up development. Outside of the academia and anything tech related, some run their own companies, some work as technical project managers, and a few of them went into completely unrelated stuff. One guy I used to hand around with in uni is an understudy to a high-end suit maker/tailor, and another mate of mine has become a doctor.,Furthermore, this data comes from an online poll which tend to be less than accurate.,Also, the blog this article is on is dedicated to, quote, ',' so one can't help but wonder if the analysis of the online poll data is flawed.,I have a lot of classmates like that. Usually I'll come in and talk about whatever projects I'm currently working on. They'll state they're waiting until winter or summer break to start something. The next semester comes along and they still haven't worked on anything. ,I also go to a few programming meet ups, and the people there have way more projects and seem more passionate than the average CS major. There's kids in HS there that have done more than me, designers working on full stack JS projects, and a lot more. I feel like these types of people are way more hirable than the CS major who focuses solely on classes and nothing else until graduation. ,[deleted],I guess Computer Science became such a vast field in recent years that we need a new term for the mathematical, statistics and big data problems. ,This pool is so inaccurate. You can't even start comparing the salary of a Big Data Engineer vs someone in Web Development. And I don't think any sort of bootcamp is enough to be able to understand the nitty-gritty in analysis. ,My $0.02,I absolutely agree, and this is why , don't need to hire people with CS degrees. The supply and demand of these two types of people is probably why the bootcamp people are making so much money compared to CS grads too. Eventually the supply of bootcamp people will be too high and the wages will likely flatten out or maybe even go down (compared to inflation).,There are also a couple other factors at play here that the data might not take into account:,My money says most of the boot camps are located around areas that pay devs higher. Just a theory.,I'm sure we will have very different sets of data, if this research was conducted by University that has computer science degree.,SO's graph note:,Something doesn't add up here. ,Oh ok, now it does.  ,Boot camps are also mostly available in major cities...NYC, San Fran, Boston etc...salaries are naturally going to be higher for cost of living.,Let me know if they adjust their data for cost of living - otherwise it sounds like something pushed out by a boot camp lobbying group. ,Not all computer science degree people go into programming though so its not really a fair comparison in terms of making more money in a programming job however I would agree that a Degree makes no real world difference. Employers only care if you can or cannot do the job,Only after your first job. There are lots of places that put minimum GPA requirements for recent college grads. ,I am not saying bootcamps are bad, but I would say those with a computer science degree have a more consistent career projection as Jr -> Mid-Level -> Sr. -> Manager, where the bootcampers usually pop into mid-level due to their more applicable experience.,I skipped the degree and wish I didn't. Although I was out earning my buddies by 10-20k when I was a teenager, I will probably never be considered for a leadership role at a larger company without that degree. Completely expecting myself to peak in a few years. In addition, I have never even been able to get an interview at a company larger than 20-30 people. Sucks bruh, resume filters are the worst. Just finish your stupid degree.,I think you're putting too much emphasis for not getting promoted on a degree.  No company is going to see someone who is motivated toward and capable of leadership and say, ""oh, no degree, guess we can't promote them."",Your technical skills, leadership ability, personality, and negotiation skills are what will get you  a promotion. ,The only thing I can think a lack of a degree barring you from is something like a CTO position, and in that case you probably need a degree from a very reputable institution. ,Funny, I have no degree but a lot of experience and have worked for two 100,000+ organizations.,[deleted],
  ,If you have more than ~5 years experience, I can't imagine very many companies verify you have a degree. I know our company wouldn't. ,Personally I wouldn't want to work for companies that require one. Those are the type of companies full of legacy code and outdated/inefficient processes. While they money may be there you are just another wheel in the cog. No thanks, I'd rather stay in the low 100,000's than work for a corporate graveyard. ,That's nonsense. I work in London and I have not yet found a single place where they asked about my degree or lack thereof, let alone reject me for not having one.,I see this at where I work. When it was a startup people with just high school diplomas could get a decent position. Now that it has been bought out twice by larger companies you won't make the initial resume cut without a 4 year degree. It's kind of stupid.,I'm skeptical about the stats. It's true that bootcamp can help someone get started with all those skills. However, if you randomly sample employees from those top companies like Google/Facebook, you can barely find anyone from some unknown schools. ,That sample is probably one of the smallest percentages of the industry.,Sorry, it kind chaps my ass how often Google/Facebook/whatever is brought up around Reddit in regards to programming. The vast majority of software engineers are not going to work at some place like that. So I think it's rarely relevant.,It all depends on the person. Either they love to code, or they like it and can work hard at it, or they don't like it. The settings for those loves and likes are important, but less so than the person's self-motivation.,I have a question. Well actually many.,I am in a CompSci degree program in Bucharest, Romania. Can these people out of bootcamps write algorithmic centered code? ,I am talking about C, C#, C++, Haskell etc.,Am I wasting my time and nerves trying to understand the mathematics that goes into coding? Am I doing this whole programming thing wrong? ,Heck, it makes me question my sanity when I see these posts with ""Bootcamp helped me land my 100k+ job"". Are you serious?,Computer Science isn't only about knowing how to use the latest web-technologies and trends and marketing them right. It's about understanding the mathematics that goes into the logical structure. And I am sorry but you cannot learn this in 8-12 weeks. Understanding and implementing Dijkstra took like a month for me.,The light at the end of the tunnel for me is that once you devote your time and learn some difficult languages, picking up on new trends and niches is easy. ,Because in webdev you don't deal with algorithms or understand how packets move around or how to traverse a binary tree. ,These scenarios can pop-up from time to time but I've never hit a low-level problem that an hour or two of googling can't solve. Most of the time there is a library or API you can use. Or occasionally a bit of code optimisation.,Web dev is more about hammering services together and wrapping them up in an neat package that as many people as possible can access.,You are better served by being able to write elegant code and having a deep knowledge of your specialty. The one exception might be if you're working at a tech giant but for most people working in agencies or startups CS just isn't a priority.,Being good at CS doesn't necessarily make you a good programmer. ,No, of course not... And I agree with you. But, ohh man is it helpful to understand the mathematical models, data types etc. when programming. ,It is the classical example of how 1K lines of code can be written in 200 if you know how to juggle math.,They can't even write semi complex JS and most of them don't get jobs. ,One of the best Jr Devs I interviewed recently came out of a bootcamp.  He showed knowledge, adaptability and intuition.  I was quite surprised actually.,made me think twice about bootcamps."
"Now, I've been slowly self learning and over the past year and I've managed to teach myself some Python and R, but I'm still missing out on other things like SQL,Tableau,etc. I figured that with enough time and practice I can get a hang of the programming aspect of DS. But it's been very difficult for me to learn HOW to actually understand, interpret and analyze the data I am working with. And for that I strongly believe that I would need the guidance of a teacher. That's why I've been strongly considering pursuing either a MS in DS or paying for bootcamps.,I live in Chicago and Northwestern university has a great MS program for analytics ( , ) as well as 24 week part time coding bootcamp( , ). I strongly believe that both of these programs will give me the skills and guidance I need to get establish a career in DS.(please correct me if this assumption is incorrect),The way I'm looking at things now is, do the part time bootcamp while working fulltime(its more affordable that way), apply for jobs(hopefully land one successfully), work for a year or two saving up some money, and then apply for the MS in DS.,Is this a good idea or am I just wasting my resources and effort with the bootcamp? Or is there another option I haven't even considered?,Thanks in advance! :),I think I might be in a similar boat as you...,I feel like it's kind of redundant to do both. I just finished a 3-month boot camp and I think if you're one of the top students of the boot camp, you're for sure going to do well in the job market.,A Masters, while costly, is going to offer a more thorough and in-depth experience. Yes, you can learn everything through MOOCs and textbooks by yourself, but they can't replace the people you get to meet from attending an actual program and meeting other students and faculty.,If you have the time and money I don't think doing a Masters is a bad choice. After my boot camp I do kind of wish I was able to learn the tools I used more in-depth because sometimes we'd cover something like Spark or Hadoop in a day or two when it definitely deserves more attention than that.,The way i see it, bootcamps are essentially accelerated BS degrees, teaching you the most important things as quickly as possible. Ideally I'd like to take my time learning and fully understand the subject matter, but practically it would be very difficult for me to take time off my job, study full time while paying of my undergrad loans and study. Thats why I'm leaning towards the bootcamp option rn. Also, how difficult was it for you to get a job after the bootcamp and did the accelerated learning process stop you from performing to meet the goals of your work?,I graduated from a bootcamp about 2 months ago. I've got a decent background for this stuff and have picked up the concepts and skills by working my ass off in the bootcamp and continuing to grind post bootcamp. I'm happy I chose the bootcamp over an MS but it aint easy. MS/PhD are wanted for most jobs or at least ml job experience but if you can convince them into talking with you and you know your stuff, they don't mind as much what your 'education' level is.,I'm still job hunting and though I got an offer from like a 1/4 ml position which I turned down I have yet to receive an offer from a true DS offer yet. That being said I'm still moving forward and enjoying learning this stuff and brainstorming project ideas to complete.,Getting a chance to talk to a hiring manager is kind of what I'm counting on if I do go the bootcamp route. If the bootcamp promises to instill in me the skills it says it will, then I'm confident that I can convince the hiring manager/recruiter that I'm fit for their position.,Would you say that you've had a hard time getting interviews? Have you been applying only to mid level jobs or have you been considering entry level positions too? Also if you dont mind, could you please elaborate on why you turned down the position you job you mentioned? ,So it all depends on the job. I’m getting interviews from analyst roles and anything to do with my past experience (perioperative it/medical technology) but i have certainly been having a harder time getting true data science interviews. I’ve probably only had 3 of the 10+ I’ve had.That being said, my goal is to get my feet in the door. I’m willing to work pretty cheap or in an industry I wouldn’t be particularly passionate about to gain useful ML experience. And some places are willing to hire for that. Mainly places that already have established teams and procedures so onboarding junior people is easier. ,The offer I turned down was highly leveraging my past hospital experience but was a java software dev role (of which I have literally no experience) and due to the fact that at this point in time I really don’t want to waste my time doing something I don’t want to do and although it paid great I decided against it. I declined respectfully and if they get funding for a true Ml position they said they’d reach back out. "

"I have a few friends telling me that it's worth doing a bootcamp compared to a masters program in data science as it's much cheaper and the time period is shorter (12 weeks vs 2 years). My reasoning is that, spending 2 years instead of 12 weeks provide more time to practice and absorb material in a structured environment. I hate included my objectives below so please let me know what you think :),Objectives:
1) Job prospects
2) Starting salary
3) Long term growth,I think employers would want you to spend more time than just a boot camp.  All the data scientists I know who went to boot camps already had PhD's in some scientific field before going to the boot camp.,This.,Employers want candidates who have a larger understanding of fundamentals and core skills, and bootcamps serve a somewhat different purpose (they focus on how to do things vs. the why).,From my data, candidates with degrees simply outperform candidates from bootcamps (performance meaning how far along the recruiting cycle they make it).,I would vote for doing a data science masters program. There is so much to learn. I would however carefully inspect the curriculum of any masters program since often professors only care about their research and can be behind the times. ,I agree with the part about having a program where we get more practice than just theory. So many programs in colleges now a days focus on theory than practical skills. ,This submission has been randomly featured in ,, a bot-driven subreddit discovery engine. More here: ,Industry doesn't know what they need, so you can write your own solution.

What companies are you interested in working for? In what capacity? What do you mean by long-term growth?,Don't make the decision based on which path carries a stronger signal for employers, but which brings the better education.,In my experience, the quality of education is highly dependent on the particular instructor you have. Before you invest time (the money is irrelevant in the long run)[1] in a semester-long course, you should verify that you are likely to have a quality instructor. Not simply an expert in the field, but an expert , the topic. The two qualities are somewhat orthogonal. Further, the field of ""data science"" is ill-defined. I suggest investigating which aspect most interests you before making a selection.,[1] A semester of data scientist's salary is usually much larger than a semester of tuition. On the other hand, a year or five difference in lifetime earnings isn't much of a difference in lifetime happiness.,Didn't downvote but you are probably getting downvoted since you are presenting the first two paragraphs as facts while you have not provided any evidence for your claim. Your tone of unwarranteed confidence and needless jargon makes you look arrogant and trying to showoff.,To claim that 60k dollars + 2 years of investment yields as much as 10k + 3 months, anyone would be cautious to make that point even with the data. Your first two unsubstantiated paragraphs do not add to the discussion.,To be fair, he said 'I suspect' before presenting his idea. Not really claiming as fact, but I do agree there is no real evidence provided.,I thought it'd be appropriate/amusing to adopt the tone of an academic paper. Instead it reduced clarity. I'll fix it.,I didn't make that claim, in fact, I do believe that finishing the masters degree will both increase employability and increase compensation. The jargon made it hard to understand. I'll revise.,Thank you very much for your insight! I am thinking of all sort of companies (from start ups to large size) and for careers in data analytics (machine learning and data visualization) to data engineering (database and parallel computing architectures). ,Given your variety of interests, I expect the university will offer you more than the bootcamp. If nothing else, you'll have more time to learn outside of the workplace before you're forced to focus on the demands of whatever job you take. Hopefully that time will give you more insight into which jobs to apply for.,Thank you very much! That was extremely insightful!"

Have you taken the GREs yet and if so how did you score?,Also try , and maybe Quora. Hopefully you can get some answers from people actually involved in the hiring process. I think it's kind of hard for anyone to really say what you should do because both data science masters and bootcamps are relatively new. So there isn't really a standard way they're perceived in industry.,I'm a bot, ,, ,. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:,[deleted],If you think an econ degree is useless you must have gone to a terrible school or chosen a bad curriculum. Economics can be an amazing degree for data science if you load up on econometrics, and the field is great for teaching you how to create, visualize, evaluate, and test economic models against real data.,It's why econ majors have among the highest salaries out of school. You don't know what you're talking about. ,[deleted],What school did you go to? It must have been a pretty garbage university if you didn't do econometrics. ,Economics is up there right under the engineering degrees. If you think it's useless, then you're pretty idiotic for purportedly getting a degree in the field without having the capacity to learn how you can apply it in the field. Also coming from someone that got a degree in bio? Is that useful?,You have no idea what you're talking about. ,[deleted],If you knew what you were talking about you would know that consulting, not finance, is the major cause for higher average starting salaries among econ majors.,So your ""econ is a useless degree"" has now become ""an econ degree is useless unless you want to do finance... or consulting.... or law.... or a quantitative field..."",At some point you just have to admit that you are wrong and you are an idiot. ,And running regressions in SPSS is not a real econometric curriculum... My econometrocs classes were mostly writing proofs and implementations of econometrics in Matlab in linear form. ,[deleted],Students almost never go from undergrad to data scientist. The vast, vast majority of data scientists have masters or PhDs. So the fact he's looking for his masters to break into the field isn't unusual or a testament to the value of an Econ degree. If you didn't know that already, you don't know as much as you think you do. ,Again, I don't know about , but at my school my econometrics consisted of actually writing proofs and implementations in Matlab in linear form- not simply running commands on a GUI or library. And the code I wrote to do that looks an awful lot like the code I'm writing in Octave as I learn machine learning. ,Econ is fantastic undergrad degree for a career in finance, law, consulting, and data (which are all high paying fields with tremendous opportunities).  If you think Econ is a ""worthless"" degree, you should know that it's your opinion that's worthless. ,[deleted],I'm in the consulting industry, getting experience by applying econometrics to real business problems. There are way more Econ grads going into consulting compared to finance, and economics is one of the main sources of entry consultant/analyst positions in the industry. ,I hope to do data science, and I know I have a TON to learn and a Masters to get before I do, but I'm only in the position I'm in because I studied economics. I went into college expecting to do law (Econ is one of the best pre-law degrees also), but taking the required intro econometric courses showed me I enjoyed data analysis and statistical computing. ,You can say I just have an ""E-peen"" but you're the one misrepresenting the value of an economics degree by calling it ""useless."" The reality is that economics is a fantastic field of study to prepare for careers in law, finance, consulting, and data. If you are calling an Econ degree ""worthless,"" you are either ignorant yet insist on giving your worthless opinion, or you know that what you're saying isn't true but you aren't capable of separating your bizarre bias against economics from your informed opinion on the matter. I don't know which is worse. ,The point is bachelor's in econ compared to master's and PhD.,You don't get to study really ""useful"" stuff in bachelor's level. All competitive economics bachelor degrees just build you to master's where it gets much more rigorous.,I mean, that is just totally wrong. I loaded up on econometrics in my undergrad curriculum, now I do econometrics/consulting in my career and have a very clear path in the field of data science. ,Economics prepares you extremely well for quantitative (or non-quantitative if you want) consulting, which pays very well and is a very good entry into data science.,If you go to a bad university that doesn't offer those courses that's different, but if you go to a bad university then you don't get to pretend like you understand the worth of a degree simply because you couldn't go to a better school for whatever reason. ,Economics is very good degree for data science career but it doesn't exclude the fact that undergrad level econometrics stay in non rigorous basic level. ,Not at my school. The capstone for my Econ concentration was in quantitative finance, and the code I wrote in Matlab to optimize a vector of weights for a bundle of assets given a vector of asset prices and risk preference looks A LOT like my code in Octave implementing staple machine learning algorithms...,I'm NOT saying graduate level stuff isn't more rigorous. I'm saying if you aren't at a bad school and take the right classes, you will DEFINITELY know enough to actually start modeling in the real world in the consulting industry. You don't need a Masters to do that, and it's a great entry point to data science. ,I wouldn't call an Economics degree useless en route to data science, but I do think it is inferior to many other degrees like math, stats, and computer science (with the right concentration). I'm finishing up my undergrad math/stats degree and have taken many courses in my school's data science master's program. In those classes I've worked with many people with econ degrees that are there for their masters. ,While they typically had a decent grasp of basic linear regression models, none that I worked with had much, if any, statistical knowledge beyond that, nor did they have much programming knowledge. Their knowledge of probability theory was laughable at best, and outright dangerous at worst. Their idea of regression was typically just throwing all available variables into a regression model using stepwise selection. If they did separate their data into training and testing datasets, they'd test their model with the same testing data repeatedly until they found a model that overfit both their training and testing data and almost exclusively used R² to compare models. None had even heard of cross validation, BIC, or AIC before their grad classes.,While I don't expect the students I worked with to represent all people with econ degrees, no other data science-related degree recipients that I worked with were as uninformed across the board. That being said, I'd probably prefer to work on a data science project with an econ major than something like a history major, but I doubt they'd be after the same job very often.,I imagine most of those employed with only an undergrad econ degree are not hired for the statistics/data science that they know, but the context in which they know it. In particular, they know how to translate their results into the jargon that their bosses would know. Math, stats, and CS students are less likely to have that same skill. So while someone with a stats degree can probably build better models than their econ counterpart, they aren't as likely to give as understandable of an explanation of them to those without strong quantitative backgrounds. That may earn them large sums of money, but that, I don't think, reflects how good they are at quantitative analyses.,I never said Econ is an optimal path to data science, and I know it isn't. A double major in stats/CS probably would be. ,Your last paragraph describes the comparative advantage that econ majors are more likely to have. At the end of the day, data science in practice is about giving your firm a tangible ROI, so the ability to translate results for stakeholders is in many cases far more valuable than marginal, or even substantial, improvement in a model. If you can't effectively communicate results or models to non-quant stakeholders, or give said stakeholders understanding and confidence in your results, then even the best models will have a worse ROI than inferior models that suceed in giving stakeholders understanding and confidence in results. ,Let's also not pretend that stats majors don't also overfit and fish for p-values. Econometrics is mostly about inference rather than prediction, so the adjustment to practices like cross-validation makes sense. I definitely agree that every econ major should take CS. I did and I now program in Java, Scala, R, some javascript for D3.js, etc. ,My coworker has a Masters in , and doesn't know nearly as much programming as I do, so the lack in CS isn't unique to econ. ,Data science is pretty much a spectrum between ""Consultant data science"" and ""data science engineering."" Econ majors are definitely more naturally fit in the left side of that spectrum and can be very successful, but I don't think that makes them inferior to those on the engineering side. At the end of the day the best quant. analyst is the one that provides the best ROI to his firm (in my opinion), not the one with the mathematically most elegant model. ,Communication is definitely a vital part of the process. Typically, an organization needs both the engineers and the communicators. While the engineers develop new insights, the communicators contextualize those insights. Only one of those, however, is data ,. The other is science communication. Even if you'd still consider that data science, what makes econ undergrads inferior to stats undergads, in my opinion, is two fold.,First, having a good model that is difficult to understand is a lot better than a bad model that is easy to understand. Operating off of bad, but easily digestible information can be very destructive. It is possible, however, to not need to even communicate your model to anyone who wouldn't understand it if it is a part of larger projects or part of an automation process. Not all data science tasks require the stakeholders' knowledge/approval. Much of it only really needs to be approved locally (I.e. the head of the data science department).,Second, an econ major is restrictive in terms of the industries in which they would have an advantage in terms of communication. Their advantage is only present in those industries and situations that their degree has trained them for. A statistics major, however, is not nearly as restrictive because the field itself is used in virtually every industry. A data science position in bioinformatics is much more likely to be filled by a stats or cs major than an econ major. ,As to your points about what I had said about the econ students I worked with, like I said they are not likely representative of all people with econ undergraduate degrees. Likewise I'm fairly confident that your knowledge and education is not representative either, particularly because I'm sure many of the skills you have now (like your programming skills) you have obtained after your undergraduate econ degree. Also, you are right that it is also far from uncommon for undergrad stats students to overfit. But, they at least know many different types of regression and analyses, and are have a deeper understanding of probability theory all of which can at least partially compensate for errors in their implementation. CS students will typically have about the same statistical knowledge as econ students (depending on the cs concentration), but they will also have much better programming skills, so they will at least be capable of creating and implementing algorithms more easily and efficiently. ,My point was that econ students did not excel in any skill. I wouldn't even classify them as a ""jack-of-all-trades"" sort of people. What they knew of CS, any half-decent stats student would know, and what they knew in stats any half-decent CS student would know. The only advantage they had was one that is only relevant in a select number of industries. Their advantage simply extends from their domain knowledge. Marketing majors have pretty much the same advantage in data science positions for marketing companies. And even at that, I'm sure that it would be easier for a typical stats major to learn the necessary jargon of finance than it would be for a typical econ major to learn something like bayesian or nonlinear regression.,Econ undergrads can certainly be useful in data science, but I don't think their skills are nearly as widely needed as other data science-related degrees.  As others have pointed out, most economics undergraduate programs are not that quantitatively rigorous (yours may have been, but it seems unlikely that yours is representative). That is inherent in pretty much all undergraduate social science degrees. Someone with only an undergraduate economics degree is , less likely make it as a successful data scientist than someone with a math, stats, engineering, or CS degree. They aren't useless in data science, but I don't think they're as useful as you seem to think they are, either.,Even if you take everything you are saying for granted, it does not make an econ degree ""useless."" You are admitting that econ is a gateway to data science, just as it is a gateway to finance, law, consulting, etc. ,So it's kind of weird that you are hung up on your belief I'm exaggerating the applicability of undergrad econometrics and economic modeling to data science, rather than the belief that an econ degree is ""useless"", which is much further from the truth than anything I've said. ,Bottom line is that an econ degree is not useless, for data science or for a number of great fields (and it's an exciting field in itself). If me challenging that assertion bothers you, it suggests you are a pretty stereotypical STEM major who can't fathom acknowledging the value in any other type of degree (comparing Econ to Marketing is absolute bullshit by the way and shows you don't really know much about either field if you think they are comparable in the fields' relevancy to data science), and if people try to do so then it bothers you enough that you have to add your two cents. ,In quantitative finance. You are also neglecting the fact that the overwhelming majority of Bachelor's Econ programs are not ""econometrics heavy"" – it's just not the focal point. ,Most people are not at your school – and so your situation doesn't represent the majority of economics graduates with minimal marketable skills (which is why they go into finance & which amusingly, your concentration was on as well). ,Sorry, but you want to swing your little e-dick on the internet, I can too. ,Your example of basic linear programming in Matlab really isn't rigorous example of undergrad econometrics.,What I agree with you is that econ undergrad econometrics very often talk about heteroskedasticity, multicollinearity and practical problems in real world data which in turn help turning into modeling real world. (Something which is not talked too much in statistics side at undergrad),I would have been really satisfied with undergrad econometrics if it had progressed beyond generalized linear models and arima in time series. ,Also Markov models and bayesian econometrics are the standard nowadays in practical econometrics. They are not taught in undergrad because the lack of time in undergrad level and you need to progress to master's in econ to really build your arsenal in modeling.,It's not just a coincidence that central banks and ministries of finance don't really employ people under PhD for full-time positions.,I'm not exactly sure what your point is. ,An undergrad econometrics curriculum is enough to get you a position applying models to real-world problems at hundreds of consulting firms across many different industries. I never asserted it would get you a job with a central bank- that is ridiculous. I asserted it is a useful degree that will allow you to get experience analyzing data. Therefore, it is not a useless degree in data science. "

The class wasn't really a comp sci class because we spent the first half of the semester doing binary by hand, and the second half doing MATLAB, but that spurred me to teach myself Python. I was really getting into it (rosalind.info), even at the expense of studying for finals, but then summer rolled around and I had signed up for a super intense 9 weeks of orgo 1 and 2 with labs, so it fell to the wayside.,Once I graduated in the fall and took a job, I thought I would get back into it again, especially since my job involves sitting in front of a computer all day doing menial office work. However, it's not really feasible, because I can't devote a solid block of time to doing it, I don't remember much of the stuff I have learned, I can't really install stuff on the computer, and, to be fully honest, there are other things I want to do with my free time once I get out of work.

I discovered coding late into my degree after taking some mandatory computational physics classes, and I enjoy the challenge of numerical techniques, Ising model problems, etc. I also enjoy the challenges of visualizing data and exploring complex physical systems, extracting interesting relationships from it and trying to convey the information in a way that gives the reader confidence in my fine-control of the system.  I found my research project was very computationally demanding and difficult, and I've actually contemplated switching away from physics because of it. While I'm a student with a good GPA (3.7 on a 4.3 scale), I've found the jump to computational research difficult simply because I don't have an excellent formal background in coding. I've had lots of support from my supervisor and other students, but physics-based coding is often tricky when you have to focus on both the language , the physics! So grad school seems like a risk precisely because I don't really have any kind of indication about what my research potential is (whether I just need more training or whether it's just not up my alley). I've taken introductory CS courses, but I have no background in data structures/algorithms or how to write nice programs to run in parallel. I often feel like I might be woefully unprepared for future research simply because I haven't been able to get my current research to really get off the ground. I love coding, however, and I see my future in it (in some way or another). ,I'm posting because I still haven't decided on post-graduate plans yet. My final offer expires on May 14th, so I'm looking for interesting thoughts or experiences that might be valuable for helping me with my final decisions. Here are my current options (all of which I have been accepted to):,If you have any opinions on my thought processes at this time, I'll happily listen to what you have to say. I'm particularly interested in anyone that may have taken a bootcamp as a physics student, even if to compare the pros and cons of the coding that occurs there. But really all input is appreciated. My choice doesn't seem as obvious as it was when I choose a school for my undergrad, which is why my decision is difficult. Thanks for reading.,For what little it's worth, I'd personally pursue one of the Master's programs, because you are never, ever going to work on anything nearly that cool on the strength of what a web dev/iOS bootcamp teaches you.,You will be giving up some opportunity cost, though; industry obviously pays a great deal better than grad school. However, I don't think it'll really hurt your job prospects afterwards; the last place I worked had a pretty decent number of people who had reached high academic achievement in quantitative fields and then went to pretty lucrative careers in industry once they got tired of academia."

Also add some SQL + database design in there, you can get a decent idea of what you're doing with that in a day and it looks nice on a resume.,No normal human can understand a math/stats book at 80 wpm.,Thanks for sharing this, I was looking for a similar feedback!,Reading textbooks aren't like reading a fiction books, those ML books are tough; they're going to take a while to digest. Spending a few weeks on ML won't give you a good understanding.,hey man, i know you got a lot of feedback already but i just want to say that you're , on the right track. you actually went out and got something going before coming on this subreddit and going 'hurr how become data science'.,math, stats, programming, etc. whatever. it doesn't matter. what matters is your attitude, how bad do you want it? i know i sound really corny right now but the attitude to stay self motivated and keep your grind going is everything.,i'm speaking from experience. i essentially mooc'd and self-taught myself into the game, and i wasn't half as organized or mature as you are. i still have a lot to learn and long way to go, but i got my foot in the door. yes, as it stands your plan has some flaws but it doesn't really matter. ,good job and good luck. i'd love to see an update from you in a few months.,Hi, thanks a lot for your feedback, I really appreciated it! Each time I hear of someone who got there with a self teach approach I get a confidence boost. 
I would love to know more about your background and briefly how you got to the DS field. 
Also I look forward to updating this thread with the actual path I will follow and I will surely create a followup subreddit in the future! ,i'm an undergraduate, a junior now, majoring in economics at michigan state university. right off the bat, behind the 8 ball - not a cs or stats student, not good gpa, not at a 'target' school, not a grad student. honestly that kind of motivated me. ,i started getting heavy into moocs around march last year. for me, my motivation was to land a data science internship at a reputable firm, and because internship recruiting starts in the fall i had 9 months to sprint towards my goal.,in those 9 months, i attacked it from all angles. i knew i had to do it that way to even have a chance. ,, i talked myself into a full-time BI internship at a startup for last summer. ,, i did a lot of courses on datacamp.com at night and read through books (hadley's stuff mostly, and , lightly)., i started the ,, which i spent a , of time getting off the ground. MSUDS was wildly successful (check out the events). it gave me a good chunk on my resume showing interest, helped me meet industry professionals, and made a name for myself. all the while still pushing myself to learn more and more, especially focusing on R.,by the end of it all, i had 5 internship offers! a return offer from the startup, 'data analyst' internship offers at quicken loans (the startup's parent company), domino's pizza, ford motor company, and finally an actual data science internship at ,. ,i don't mean to sound like a braggart, but all of these firms were bending over backwards to try to get me. like ranking analytics officers personally calling and emailing me, extending acceptance deadlines, bending/breaking policy and listing requirements... in the end zillow's offer blew away the others in every conceivable category, so it was a no brainer. ,fwiw, i got my foot in the door at ZR by meeting a grad student here through MSUDS who did the same internship last summer. but after that i killed it on the take home assessment using skills i learned over the summer, then had the best interview of my life, and locked up the job the next day.,i feel awkward as a kid giving you, an established professional, advice... but really, it is all about the attitude. because im young and stupid i could make a lot of sacrifices that most can't, but still. it's all about how badly you want it. that's the biggest lesson i learned from this whole ordeal.,I'd recommend , for learning neural networks. It's a very practical course: it skips much of the math and theory and jumps straight to building neural networks in Python.,Don't forget data visualization, cleaning, and munging - in fact I'd start with these even before the math - that way you can get your feet wet right away and start building mini-projects.,I got a lot of the math part down but not much of those 3; any suggestions/resources for learning those?,for data visualization, cleaning etc I recommend checking out the online lectures from CS109 at Harvard. Most of the course content is on Github.,This is not a good way to becoming a data scientist, the hardest part of data science are not the hard skills, but the setting up of data experiments and building real hands on experience. This is why having a github of personal projects are so important. Theoretical Understanding is of course important, but I really dont think you are going to get a stronger understanding of the topics when compared to a bootcamp graduate, which for the most part is very low. ,I would start with what type of data scientist you want to be, and then learn/build projects from that. Are you interested in computer vision? Are you interested in AI? Are you interested in pure analytics? ,The reason why people like PhDs in data scientist, most of all, is not that they have spent a ton of time in class, but because they have approached a problem that they had very little knowledge on and came out an expert. You can do that too, by copying other people's work and attempting to understand it. You do not need to be original, but you need to learn how to think about data problems.  This is the biggest flaw of MOOCs, Bootcamps (I attended btw), and text books. ,If your goal is to get a Job in data science, you need to both learn a skill and produce a measureable result to put on your resume/github. The rest of the stuff you can learn on the job. Thats the most efficient way of doing this. ,Khan Academy's calculus classes are excellent. If you need calculus, I would recommend those, but haven't seen the Udemy ones. That being said, I don't see anything in your plan that requires calculus I II and III. I bet  you could condense the calculus and statistics into fewer classes/books and get where you are going. ,Also, you might be better off staggering the math and data-science classes. It's a tall order to learn all that math before putting it into practice. I would try to find complementary subjects. Maybe, basic statistics, then the machine-learning boot camp, or something like that. ,A great way to start might be with Statistics The Easier Way With R, if you go the R root. This would be a great starting point. ,Hi and thanks a lot for your feedback. I also don't know about Khan Academy vs Udemy, but I will have a better look at both.,You mean that I could skip the whole calculus block and dive straight into statistics?,That's a great suggestion. I will also put something into practice as soon as I have some basic knowledge that gives me that possibility. While learning math and statistics I will also practice with exercises. ,Do you think the estimate timeframes for the various parts of my study plan look reasonable?,I'm a bit confused on the calculus part, given your mechanical engineering background. Generally, mechanical engineering curricula are heavier on calculus than comp sci or data science curricula, so I would assume that you would be good to go with your uni calculus knowledge.,I had 2 math classes while I was in university but that was ~8 years ago... I don't really know what's left in my head of all that math :D,Calculus I, II and III is required before acceptance to a program for a MS in statistics. If you want to be a statistician, then it might be useful. However, a more basic understanding would probably be fine for most of us. ,I think the most important takeaway, is you should start learning, then practicing, then learning again. Actually, I like to say, ""Learn, Use, Teach, Learn....."" If you find that you need Calc II, go ahead and take it. Let the material you are learning show you what you need. ,As for timing, I suspect it will be very difficult to predict. I am always way under in my predictions. ,Thanks, I appreciated your feedback a lot.,One more thing. You describe a very linear path for learning. You will want to practice as well. You should work on your own project in between some of the classes and books. ,Looks good! I certainly believe a strong math background is very helpful in any field,That being said, as a fellow beginner, I am curious which parts of the series above will reinforce core fundamental processes. What I am talking about is things like data cleaning, intermediate statistical data analysis (things like linear regression, simulations, multiple regression, parametric / nonparametric tests), data visualization (libraries in python like pandas / matplotlib / seaborn / jupyter notebooks or R like ggplot / rmarkdown), or other things that may be really helpful in industry (unix / bash scripting / basic programming / automation / sql),I also see you mentioned datacamp in the post above and that you wanted to focus on python - just for reference there is a slightly more costly website that has similar content in python called dataquest. As a disclaimer, I do have an account there but I find it to be overpriced. ,As a recommendation, I would keep the math in the beginning but play a lot of the videos at double speed. Some things will be more useful than others (Linear Algebra / Stats / Multivariable Calculus) and some others may be useful to add (probability). Before jumping into introduction to statistical learning, perhaps a quick runthrough of the python data science handbook (,) would be useful for getting the hang of numpy / pandas / matplotlib. Seaborn is prettier than matplotlib (imo) and basically is a simple to use library that builds onto matplotlib and pandas. ,Here are some other cool resources you may find useful or interesting that I have been adding to my evergrowing bookmarks:,Top Data Science Resources on the Internet Right Now:

,Hi and thanks a lot for your feedback!,I hope some of the books will go through the , even if I'm pretty sure some of those you pointed out will be missing, I will have to do some more specific searches regarding some more advanced statistical data analysis. I am sure there will be still a huge amount of things to learn and I will adapt the learning path as I go.,Thanks for the suggestion on datacamp/dataquest, I will try both of them hopefully.,Regarding the playback speed of the video, unfortunately I don't think I will be able to follow them at 2x, I usually tend to use 1.5x depending on the subject and the pace of the video itself.,I will review all the resources you shared and will eventually update the post!,Do you think the estimate timeframes for the various parts of my study plan are reasonable?,I think the timeframe really depends on how deeply you go into each topic. Keep in mind that you are condensing some things that (even bright) college students do over a 3 month span. ,Theres also the stickiness of each idea - when rushed through some things will either not make sense or not be clear enough to give a full picture. Sadly, some things just take time to settle and (for me)math is one of them.,I would also consider that as you learn, more topics will become apparent that might cause a deviation from the plan. ,I make plans like this as well (a very smart thing to do!), and, even with dilligent daily work this proverb always rings true:,When people make plans, god laughs,You vastly underestimate the amount of time its going to take you to actually learn these things, instead of just going through the course.  ,For example, you are anticipating reading and understanding the information in ""Think Stats"" in two days.  That's a hilariously naive estimate.  ,Take your time frames for finishing these things, and multiply them by a factor of 10, and you might have slightly more realistic estimates.,Thanks for sharing your feedback, as many other suggested I have greatly underestimated the time I will take for each block. Thanks also for giving me a quantitative factor to adjust those estimates. ,So I too am trying something similar and have started my journey about 6 months ago.. have a full time job, so am giving myself another 2 years to be fully employable in this space.. I do get to use a little bit of Python at work so helps learning in that regard.. have done a few Udemy courses on Python and then on Data Viz with Python. As I moved onto stats (have covered these in post-grad, though that was a while ago) I found that the best stats course were on Udacity: Descriptive and Inferential Statistics.. they are long, but are just fantastic to give you the intuition as well as rigor .. am chugging through those at the moment as the main task while still doing some Python algorithms on the side. So yeah, suggestion would be to do these two on Udacity and a lot of stats would be done. ,Hi and thanks for your feedback! I'm curious, what's your background? And does your actual job have anything to do with data analysis/ data science?,Hiya.. I have been in banking for the longest time.. and my job currently is to do with a lot of data analysis.. looking at loan exposures, coming up with smarter ways to look at risk we have.. but no, not so much with data science, unless I define it.. hence am trying to build up my learning so as to maybe apply at work first and then hopefully in a full time DS space ,My grad course is using UML and CIML as texts.  UML is pure learning theory, it is very dense and hard to read and will very casually assume you know a lot of basic math (by basic I mean upper level undergraduate).  I think UML would be probably be skipped for anyone except people looking to do straight up learning theory research.,CIML on the other hand is very gentle and his proofs are easy to digest.  The downside is the book is still very rough.,Here is some data on the amount of time it takes to learn math. I've been going to school for the past couple years. Almost done! I use toggle.com to track the time I spend. For Calc I, I spent 104 hours over 8 weeks and got an A. For Calc II, I spent 124 hours over 8 weeks and got a C+. Linear algebra was 80 hours over 8 weeks and I got an A. These were college courses, but no projects/papers were involved. All the time was spent learning math.  Also, I thought I had a natural mind for math, until I took calc II. ,Very nice insights thanks!! ,toggle.com has nothing to do with what you're talking about. with some googling i'm guessing you meant toggl.com?,Oops. Yeah, toggl.com.,Thank you for this post. I'm kind of in a similar position now. Could you please recommend me any podcasts? Where to find them? iPhone user here.,I already know Python and in my opinion you should become intermediate in Python. Learning R will be much smoother.,Hi, I saw a user in , suggested the 3 podcasts I wrote above,but honestly I have not yet done any personal search.,Also, when you say , you mean that it would be easier to learn R rather than Python or the opposite? Thanks,I would go with Python as the first language mostly due to the fact that the community is big and there are high quality tutorials everywhere while R is really for some specialists. They both are quite similar but you will always use Python for something in data science even if your primary tool will be R."

fernandodata.com,What were the mistakes you made?,I would be highly interested in any suggestions/words of wisdom you may have! ,I start Galvanize's Data Science Immersive program in a month. It's a pretty big career change. I was a data analyst for about 4 years and then transitioned to front end/GUI type build using a hospital EHR software called Epic and did that for the past 3 years.  I wanted to get back into the nitty-gritty that is data and coding. I am excited for this new career, but nervous. ,So yeah, any rookie mistakes I should avoid or things you wish you knew when you were in my shoes are welcome! ,Hey hootsincahoots! Thanks for reaching out and sorry for the late reply, won't happen again. , 
Since you have some coding background and your bootcamp will help you prepare to hit the job market I think these are things that I learned and I think are important for anyone going into a bootcamp:, 
A. Build your projects around what industry you want to work in. Many new data scientists go for projects that are too tough (I tried to predict when a coup would happen) so instead focus on projects that have clear and actionable takeaways that relate to where you want to work. For example if you want to work in education build a MOOC recommender., ,B. Realize that getting a job in data science and having data science skills are two COMPLETELY different skills. To get a great job you have to focus on creating a compelling website, telling great stories about your projects,  constant reach out to hiring managers, and be great in telling your career story. Once you're done with the bootcamp don't fall into the trap of just working on your data science skills, I would argue that that comes second to marketing yourself. DS skills don't disappear but they take a second seat. , ,C. Realize that the bootcamp network is what will be disproportionate returns in the long-run. At the start tap into alumni to get referrals, this works amazingly! But in the long term you will see how each person in your cohort will do amazing things and learn so much that you can learn from them. A bootcamp is an intimate experience so really foster those relationships! I host alumni meetups once every two months and it's amazing to see what I can learn from the network. So organize your bootcamp's alumni meetups!, ,These are three things I found important hootsincahoots! Let me know what you think or if you have any more questions, don't hesitate to reach out to me at ,As a self-learner, there's so much content out there that much of it doesn't benefit me to learn at a random time. ie., If I don't know how to use Python or C++, reading articles about Tensor flow isn't too productive, even though it's interesting. Learning about the pathways that others took and which points of learning they recommend, while forgetting about all those that didn't help them out, is great!,I am quite new to the field as well. Here is what I have planned. Please suggest any improvements where required.,Degree:,Enrolled in Master of Business Analytics (Data Science Specialisation),MOOCS:,Goals:,Lastly, apply for a Graduate Data Analyst job.,What do you guys mean by ""MOOCS"",You shouldn't have this attitude if you are getting into Data Science. A simple google search will tell you.,MOOC: A massive open online course,I don't see how a data science crash course can meaningfully provide the skills and knowledge through cramming.,While i agree you 100% of what you wrote, there are a surprisingly large number of well taught courses on various aspects of ""data science"", be it different machine learning models, deeper divers into statistical/mathematical theory, becoming proficient at new languages, frameworks, tools, etc. The content/effort required to get through (and actually understand) some of these courses is absolutely non-trivial. I'm a (100% research focused) data scientist at a Fortune 50 company and I use MOOC's regularly to supplement my skillset, as does my brother (who is currently working towards his PhD in a very data sciencey discipline at Stanford). The superiority complex I've often seen expressed in these types of discussions when judging themselves  vs. those who enroll in MOOC's can be downright shameful at times. Not accusing you specifically of this, rather saw this thread as an opportunity to maybe get some people rethinking their views of MOOC's and maybe evaluating how they came to form those views (did they do any of their own research or did they just dismiss the idea outright). ,[deleted],I'm technically not in a 'Data Science' position I am in a 'Data Engineering' position which means I have to, hunt all the data down, collect it, organize it, analyze it, and build web apps to present it. ,Which means I get to be mediocre at everything and an expert at nothing. It is honestly stressing me out for my career, but I am learning sooo much general data tools. ,Thanks for the advice ""new to the field"" I'm sure I'll learn to be an asshole like you in no time,Asshole it is then. If you can't even make an effort to google what MOOC is and then get offended over the fact that I pointed out your lack of ability to look up information. I really wonder who is the one with the real issue here.,I work in consulting and I wish I could answer that to my coworkers sometimes... If I know they won't get offended I'll send them a let me google that for you ,If you don't want to answer it then don't answer it I don't see why you had to be a cunt about it,I am getting a PhD in biology and have decent experience with R and GIS. The coding part of my work is probably the most enjoyable aspect to me so I'm strongly considering getting into data science after I graduate, but I feel a bit clueless on the best way to make the transition. Would appreciate any advice!,Bioinformatics?,Population genomics. I use bioinformatics as a tool pretty regularly but it's not my focus.,What major should an aspiring data scientist do?,I'd say that anything that gives a good heap of Statistics is important. Optimization algorithms are useful, too, but realistically Statistics are the backbone of all Machine Learning algorithms, and it lets you actually understand what you're doing instead of just ""pressing buttons and levers on a black box"".,In my (short) experience statistics have been instrumental in understanding what tasks are brought before me.,Hey SPal123, ,I really have no idea. I actually think that all of data science can be learned faster and more efficiently without going to school. A bootcamp and then having more real world experience is better. I could be wrong but it seems like that's where the future of data science is going. ,Let me know what you think! You can reach out to me at ,I recently completed a MOOC on edX from Microsoft called ""DAT204x Introduction to R for Data Science"". It requests 100 USD for a verified certificate, but I feel like this is amount of money is large to get a certificate. What do you think ? Would those kind of certificates matter to you as an employer ?,You are much better off showing solid independent projects, internship experience and a solid set of professional references from those internships and research faculty.,Nope, probably not.,Depends on how hard your local (or non-local) job market is. Ideally your knowledge should suffice, but sometimes the certificate will be the ""thing"" that gets you slightly above the competition.,I had taken a screenshot of the final progress report which included my grade.,Been a reports analyst for about a year now and feel like I'm wasting too much time creating and running reports and updating very basic dashboards exclusively through Excel. ,What would you recommend I learn, or classes to enroll in to help me become faster and more efficient at my job?,I don't think a reports analyst is the same thing as data scientist.,Somewhat similar though. Yes not exactly the same but am curious on what I can learn to improve myself..,If you don't know any programming, or at least you don't know Python I'd start there. Just pick up any MOOC like codecademy and start.,When you've gotten the Python basics down, and made a couple of simple programs you can start learning some DS. I'd bet you'd find some good resources online searching for ""data science python introduction"".,If it helps motivate you, try to think about some boring repetitive stuff you do often at work and try to automate it with python. ,Good luck, it's worth the effort!,Probably should have mentioned I know the basics of SQL, Python, PHP, Javascript, but I just don't use it. ,You'd better start using it then ;) Honestly a Google search for some online resources is the best bet. Considering the OP hasn't responded to anyone I've got a feeling this post was just a plug.,I've got good experience with dataquest.io. They've got an easy to use website that's very modular. Just choose the topics that interest you and start playing around. At the same time you should check out Kaggle and try to find stuff that you think look manageable, and learn by trying. ,I don't think JavaScript is particularly necessary for data science.,Yea data science is backend heavy, but knowing JavaScript would likely be seen as a positive in any data science role. Maybe you wouldn't use it ever, but you'd work with people that do. ,Can you explain how front end web dev would be a plus in data science?,Well, it can be two pronged: on one end, it can help with scraping data. Not essential, and you'd learn enough through the process to be functional, but it could help.,Another way to look at it is more along the lines that knowing it would help you interact with the actual front end people on a potentially more productive level, if you happened to do the type of data science that creates ""data products"" that potentially become consumer facing at some point.,I wouldn't say that you should learn JavaScript if you don't know it, I'm just saying it could be a plus if you did.,Would you recommend a MSc Data Science or MSc Comp Sci?,Comp Sci ,could you elaborate on your preference for comp sci over data science?,There are a lot of moocs that you can do for much cheaper than a Masters degree. Most educational institutions are just cashing in on the data science hype and the field is pretty much in its infancy. Most data analyst/science degrees around the world have not even produced their first graduates yet. Such degrees end up focusing on too much on theory and less on the hard technical skills as the subjects are designed mostly by academics. Only advantage you may have is the industry placement/internship that you get as part of the degree. ,Computer science degree on other hand gives you more options. By the time you graduate, you already got your hands dirty in programming, you can specialise in a different field of your choice (Networks,data,software engineering, cybersecutity, AI). After graduation you can pick up a few well renowned data science moocs and see if it is your thing. Picking up R or Python should be a walk in the park. By taking the latter option you walk out with more choices.,What about top schools like NYU?,Sorry, I live in Australia. Do some searching around to see why Comp Sci is preferred. Pretty sure it will be the same reasons as I mentioned.,Hey the_siloviki! Thanks for you question!!!,To be honest, I have no idea.
And to be honest a second time, I would argue that having a killer set of projects and work experience is worth more than a masters.
