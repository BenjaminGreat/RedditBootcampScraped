"<p>This is an archived post. You won't be able to vote or comment.</p>,<p>The ranking looks quite arbitrary to me. Insight DS bootcamp is missing and that is really good.</p>,<p>I am asking b/c this bootcamp is ranked #3 in top DS bootcamps in USA and they have a partime online bootcamp.  Other bootcamps are F2F classrooms for 3 months which means I have to resign or take a sabbatical from my job.  I have a phobia of being unemployed so online bootcamp (4 to 6 months) is attractive.  </p>,<p><a href=""https://www.switchup.org/research/best-data-science-bootcamps"">https://www.switchup.org/research/best-data-science-bootcamps</a> </p>,<p>This report was clearly compiled by someone who is not a data scientist. The ranking is simply an aggregation of bootcamps with high student reviews and reflects nothing on the quality of the curriculum or career placement data.</p>,<p>Everyone in the industry knows <a href=""http://insightdatascience.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Insight</a> is the best, however, they should not be considered a true bootcamp as they only take PhDs and its more fitting to call it a ""fellowship program.""</p>,<p>Those ranking are pretty arbitrary. You should check in with a handful of them that are near you and get a feel from the atmosphere if you're planning on FtF. For online just start learning, they're all pretty cheap and you get what you pay for but could be nice for getting your feet wet.</p>,<p>I checked them out a few years ago and my instinct is to advise against it. </p>,<p>Try and talk to some of the alumni - I did that and found their stories to be less than what I was hoping for. </p>,<p>That is what OP is trying to do through this post!</p>,<p>Kinda to build off this. It's just hard to 'sell' a bootcamp as credentials. I think try to find the lowest cost bootcamp to get the knowledge and then make sure you're building a portfolio to help demonstrate how your skills will apply to the job. </p>,<p>Hi Saul, why do u say bootcamps are hard to sell as credentials?  Have you talked to bootcamp grads? Also were you or your company ever been involved in recruiting bootcamp grads?  </p>,<p>I say that because it's my opinion that hiring manager asking for 'x' years of experience are not going to be inclined to hire someone with 'x' weeks of experience. Now this doesn't mean that people from boot camp don't get hired. I'm trying to get across that boot camps are not a silver bullet to employment issues. </p>,<p>Thank you for your response Saul.  I think the reason why US has a tech worker crisis is that the hiring managers and their HR partners are way too picky.  They want candidates with tons of years xp but they are not willing to give people straight out of bootcamp/grad school a chance.  So they hire H1B candidates from India but Trump will put a stop to that.  I am not trying to be political here but it would be interesting if hiring managers are forced to hire and train not completely qualified US workers and develop them.   </p>"
