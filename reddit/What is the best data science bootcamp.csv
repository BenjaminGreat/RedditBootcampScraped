The better the FAQ, the harder we can come down on lazy posters with low-effort OPs, which means a higher quality subreddit experience for <strong>you</strong>.</p>,<p>I know that data science bootcamps are much different from web developer bootcamps. I was wondering if there was anyone that took a data science bootcamp and what were their experience like and the outcome of that was. Thanks!</p>,<p>I would be highly, highly suspect of a Data Science bootcamp. Moreso than I am of a Software Engineering bootcamp. You might be able to learn at least how to program in a bootcamp. I don't think you'll learn that and the math behind Data analysis though</p>,<p>It depends on what kind of data analysis.</p>,<p>If OP wants a job doing relatively simple ETL with some end-user reporting, a Data Science bootcamp would be an extremely expensive and unnecessary way to prepare for that.</p>,<p>Most data science jobs (data <em>science</em> vs. data <em>analyst</em>) require a mathematics-based BS (CS, Math, Stats), and prefer advanced education (MS, PhD).</p>,<p>So I agree. No. A boot camp is not a good way to go.</p>,<p>Where do graduates of data science bootcamps end up?</p>,<p>I'm just one dude, but I've never seen a resume cross my desk with a Data Science boot camp listed. I've never heard it brought up in interviews.</p>,<p>I don't know if that's meaningless or telling.</p>,<p>Data science generally requires such a high level of education, anyone qualified to teach it will have much better options than running a bootcamp.</p>,<p>Usually people teach because it's their passion. People normally don't teach because they don't have any or option.</p>,<p>I don't think that's true. Every teacher I know went into it because they had no other option. </p>,<p>Look, data science is <em>hard.</em> People who are good at it just aren't that likely to be running bootcamps. If they do teach, they teach at universities. Ok, you might stumble across a unicorn, but you've got to be wary. Most (if not all) of what you run across will be trash.</p>,<p>[deleted]</p>,<p>Yep. I think there are some high-quality code bootcamps out there and I think they're a good way of learning quickly, but data science? Eh, that one is a lot riskier.</p>,<p>Just because you haven't encountered any, doesn't mean there aren't. I knew someone that dropped out of software engineering working at one of the Big 4 to teach community college. People don't just go into teaching because they don't have any other options. </p>,<p>Sorry, we're going off track here but I find that to be a very arrogant thing to say. Teachers are undervalued in our society and they deserve our respect. </p>,<p>When did I say I didn't respect teachers?</p>,<p>Don't get sidetracked by the moral argument. I'm just describing your actual probabilities of finding a good course.</p>,<p>Don't do it, go college suffer for two years and have a job for the rest of your life.</p>,<p>I would be more convinced if you could provide me reasons or why you think this</p>,<p>Two years ago I went to coding boot camp which is similar to data science and started going to networking events, meeting recruiters and the industry officials. Many recruiters which I talk to will not hire anyone from any kind of boot camps. Their number one preference was a technical degree. Now I am pursuing CS degree and I have recruiters waiting for me to graduate so they hire me. </p>,<p>Just remember there is no shortcuts in life go the long route and you will be happy with it. </p>,<p>Moreover, data science is hard and you need several months on subject in order to understand it. Our brains can't process a lot of information in one day which coding boot camps offer. </p>,<p>[deleted]</p>,<p>Well what if I have a computer science bs degree and was looking for a software engineering job that works closely with the data science team. Would a bootcamp be useful in that case?</p>,<p>Go on Kaggle and work on improving your rank directly. Data science is shifting so quickly that you're better off looking at the problems companies need solving directly, and deriving a ""lesson plan"" for what you need to learn to solve them yourself.</p>,<p>It's a plausible track - one guy got hired at DeepMind with a Bachelor's and less than a year's actual work experience because of his Kaggle rank. He now works with the NHS detecting eye anomalies.</p>,<p><a href=""http://blog.kaggle.com/2016/07/11/from-kaggle-to-google-deepmind-an-interview-with-jeffrey-de-fauw/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.kaggle.com/2016/07/11/from-kaggle-to-google-deepmind-an-interview-with-jeffrey-de-fauw/</a></p>,<p>I hope someone is able to give you some first hand information.  Unfortunately, I have only looked into them a bit and my google-fu would add little to the conversation.  I left the military some time ago and was looking to use my GI benefits to attend one of these while I was between contracts, but was having a tough time 'trimming the fat' on the massive list of bootcamps available these days.</p>,<p>Is the bootcamp you were looking at also on Course Report? If not, I would look elsewhere. </p>,<p>Anyways, Microsoft has Data Science training through edX and/or Udacity. There is also <a href=""https://www.udemy.com/data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp-with-r/"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> course by a data scientist turned educator, which can be purchased for $10 during promotional sales.</p>,<p>Bootcamps sometimes have negative stigmas attached to them, but many developers have gone through them and eventually remove them from resumes after being employed. Your success will be the willingness and hard work you put into the camp, usually by completing projects that solve a business problem that can be showcased on a resume.</p>,<p>What is course report? And meh, I'm not really a fan of online learning. The way I learn, I will need that human connection.</p>,<p>Right, I know that sometimes people have different learning preferences. I'll actually be taking classes myself after two years of self teaching. </p>,<p>Course Report is basically a Yelp for bootcamps.</p>,<p>If you need human connection in order to learn, it might be worth considering whether you really want to attack something like Data Science. It's incredibly abstract. The vast majority of your education will be reading abstract formulas and papers.</p>"
