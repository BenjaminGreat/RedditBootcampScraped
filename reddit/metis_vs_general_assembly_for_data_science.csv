"<p>This is an archived post. You won't be able to vote or comment.</p>,<p>I'm looking into data science bootcamps in NYC, and I'm not sure which bootcamp is better... Metis or General Assembly?</p>,<p>Which program will be easier to get into?
Which program is more highly respected by potential employers?</p>,<p>*A little background info - I do not have a strong computer science/math background, but I did take two graduate level quantitative analysis courses (which I loved) while getting my MPA that used Stata. I also have limited experience with Minitab, SQL, and Java. I am also working on the JHU data science courses through Coursera and will be attempting to learn Python in the upcoming months. </p>,<p>Can't speak for GA but do know that Metis gets some experienced people (phd, etc) and their graduates go to some well known places.</p>,<p>source: got into metis. chose to do self taught instead because $$. </p>,<p>I'm assuming that you're using this to get a junior level data science role.  If that's not the case, my recommendation would be different.</p>,<p>There's some bias against bootcamps on this subreddit.  If you're having problems with self learning, you should do one.  Ideally, you could do everything for free, but some people need a push, accountability of the classroom, helpful guidance / teaching, etc.</p>,<p>The worst thing would be to fail at learning on your own and quit after investing significant time.  From your post, it doesn't seem like you'd have issues learning on your own.</p>,<p>That all said, if you think that you'd have to pick between the two, I'd choose Metis.  There's a stronger emphasis on producing a portfolio, which is going to be an important part of demonstrating your competency.  If you have a PhD (I believe required), absolutely choose Insight.</p>,<p>I'd like to add, that as someone who probably could have gotten a job without the bootcamp with a few months of self study, what I am getting out of the bootcamp is a lot of job help, which turns out I needed more, so the bootcamp is good for someone who needs familiarization with the tools of the trade and interviewing/professional help. I have never had a job outside of academia... so I had no idea what to expect!</p>,<p>Graduate of Metis here. In short, boot camps are absolutely worth it <em>if you are at the right point in your career.</em> However, you have to be aware of your past experience and adjust your post-camp expectations accordingly. </p>,<p>In long: </p>,<p>Graduated with a BS in Journalism, two years of grad school for data journalism (basically data science with a focus on visualization and less stats.) Decided about a year ago I didn't want to be a journalist anymore, chose to take my data cleaning skills into the tech space. Applied to Metis and went, even though my programming and stats skills were probably on the lower end of the bell curve, compared to the rest of the students. Got out, took a crappy summer job then ended up building databases and basic DS dashboards as an analyst at a top-3 marketing company. </p>,<p>If I had not taken this camp, I would be grinding away at a $28-k a year job, now I make more than double that and life is great. I'm not a ""data scientist"" - I would need a PhD in machine learning to get those roles at Google, and a lot more experience to have that title even at a smaller company - but I'm the most ""data-literate"" person on my team and the demand for that keeps growing. </p>,<p>Definitely do Metis. They take much higher-quality applicants than GA and the job opportunities are better.</p>,<p><strong>There is no right point in your career if you want to change what you are doing.</strong> Data Science, as we know it, wasn't around 10-15 years ago and 10 years from now there will be careers in fields that we have not even thought of yet.   Your interests and perspectives on life also will change as you get older.  It could mean a career change at 35, 45, or 50.  Sometimes that career change may come because of a firing or layoff.  Would attending a bootcamp in order to learn a new field be the wrong choice in that situation?  I think not.</p>,<p>For the love of God, do not do General Assembly</p>,<p>What makes you say that?</p>,<p>I would instead recommend a course on udemy if you want a full course for cheap. They are $10 for the next few days. Jose Portilla makes good ones, I took his R course and I learned a whole bunch.</p>,<p>But will employers consider someone who learned through MOOCs?</p>,<p>Yes, for junior roles they will consider someone who has MOOC experience.  It's all about whether or not you can do the work or pass their technical interview.</p>,<p>source: have hired for junior analyst / data scientists in the past, know that other hiring managers feel similarly</p>,<p>When you see applicants who have MOOC experience, how do they generally present that on their resume? Does it matter if they have paid for the course to get the ""certificate""?</p>,<p>Either under Education or Other Education.</p>,<p>No, it doesn't matter.</p>,<p>I know that udacity.com has a high employment rate, but it is expensive (possibly as expensive as a bootcamp). However, it's much more about displaying your competence through projects that you publish on github or other places, as well as having a good interview.</p>,<p>I actually teach the Udemy course, I wouldn't say the certificate is super valuable, but my courses try to get you to a point where you have multiple projects you can show to potential employers. Pm if you have any questions</p>,<p>Another Metis grad here. I have also taken part-time courses at GA and done plenty of MOOCs.</p>,<p>Biggest advantages of Metis over GA or MOOCs:</p>,<p>Curriculum - Metis is really well planned. I graduated about a year and a half ago and have used nearly everything I learned in a professional setting since. You could get many of the same skills through MOOCs, but not as quickly, and there may be some skills you don't even know that you should learn â€“ for instance, most DS courses focus on the machine learning &amp; statistics aspect, but what about data infrastructure? automating tasks? planning and building a project end to end? presenting your findings to a live audience??? Metis teaches all of the above. I've also heard from students of the GA data science bootcamp that the course felt a bit slapped together, that GA developed the course quickly to compete with schools like Metis.</p>,<p>Career support - For MOOCs this is non-existent. GA does some but it doesn't come close to Metis. The career team at Metis takes the time to get to know all the students and supports you with introductions to employers, networking opportunities, resume/cover-letter writing workshops, interview practice (both technical and soft-skills), salary negotiation workshops, etc. etc. etc. (the career team is awesome). Most alums that I know now work as data analysts, data scientists, junior data scientists, or data engineers. It all depends on your previous experience, strengths, and interests.</p>,<p>Are bootcamps worth it? Absolutely, changed my career, changed my life.</p>,<p>I looked into other bootcamps before I chose Metis and I felt that they were the best.</p>,<p>Do not do a bootcamp. It is a waste</p>,<p>If bootcamps are a waste, what do you recommend doing instead? </p>,<p>Disagree. Metis changed my life and career </p>,<p>Don't do a boot camp. If you don't have a mathematical/quantitative background you'll need to develop that first. Kahn Academy has some great courses on Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability, and Statistics which form the foundation of every method a data science practitioner uses.
In my experience, the bootcamps focus on surface level usage of libraries like sklearn, statsmodels, pandas, and keras but don't help you build depth in quantitative problem solving which is the actual job. Those candidates consistently fail out of our hiring process for this reason. I haven't seen any evidence that they add value. The Insight program might be the exception due to their tight relationship with employers, but it is also free.

Reasons for Metis over General Assembly:</p>,<p>Coming from an undergraduate degree in economics and realizing that teaching myself to code would only get me so far, Metis was the perfect choice to pivot my career. I'm now making more money than I thought was possible at a young age and working as a Data Scientist.</p>,<p>I would 100% go for Metis</p>,<p>As far as boot camps go.  Choose Metis.  It is accredited and backed by Kaplan Learning (Test Prep).  It is no fly by night operation.  The instructors are good and they do try and give you some of the theory behind the ML algorithms.  They use Python which is the standard in the tech industry.  Also, the career office <strong>will</strong> get you prepared to go out there and find a position(one their strengths).  Add to that, the alumni network is a strong one which also helps in finding jobs.</p>,<p>Please read this before you decide you want to attend a Data Science bootcamp <a href=""https://datasciencebootcamps.com/2015/09/26/considering-a-data-science-bootcaps-program-questions-to-ask-things-to-look-for-and-look-out-for/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://datasciencebootcamps.com/2015/09/26/considering-a-data-science-bootcaps-program-questions-to-ask-things-to-look-for-and-look-out-for/</a></p>,<p>Hell, I am currently in GA's bootcamp. In the class, there is a range of people in this class. A few people who advanced degrees from top universities in physics and math, a few people who don't have a technical background. This is a very good class. My background is in physics and computer science (I hold an advanced degree), and for me its a very fast way of applying what I already know to the tools of data science. I am not learning a lot of concepts, but more of how to use specific tools. Some people are learning concepts, because they havent had multivariable calc, or linear alegebra, but for an entry level job (as an analyst) I'm not sure thats important. Most people here had little programming experience, and I think thats the biggest struggle. The reason I decided to join is because the instructor here (I'm not in NYC) is a very good data scientist and has leading technical roles for big DS companies. What I will say is that GA tends to help out its strongest students and kind of let the weaker ones fail. If you are constantly getting top scores on your projects, doing inventive stuff, the outcomes team goes full stop for you. When they talk about their statistics on jobs, they give an arbitrary cutoff, which has to do with how skilled you are in a program and how much effort you go to find a job. Personally, as someone who has been an academic for their entire career, being immersed in the industry driven program is helping out a lot. For someone who a strong technical background who has been in industry, I think MOOCs and self learning is sufficient. For me, I was a bit lost because there is so much information out there on how to transition to data sciences that I decided to pay for this bootcamp. Its curated, has relevant experiences, and the instructor here is sharp enough to answer any of my questions. He's even helped me go beyond what the class is learning now since for someone with an advanced degree (or CS background, probably) the class moves a little slow. </p>"
