"<p>Not sure, but anyone who has a chance to get a DS job understands that such a survey will provide no useful information. </p>,<p>This approach is rife with biases, shortcomings, but I think it can shine a limited light on bootcamp outcomes, relative to the placement data provided by bootcamps themselves. I received 17 responses when <a href=""http://www.datatau.com/item?id=18873"">I posted it at DataTau</a>, including some from PhDâ€™s working at well-known tech companies. They apparently found the survey worthwhile enough to complete, with critiques left in the survey comments (which I appreciate).</p>,<p>Doesnt that just make an assumption on how much they valued their time at the survey time. People take the time to upvote ""not hotdog""</p>,<p>I'd want to help you, but the combination of bootcamp, graduation date, and prior field would nail down my identity even without naming my company. So it's not exactly anonymous...</p>,<p>I gave correct general details but lied about exactly where I was, what exact degree I have (i said quantative) and Did not disclose where I worked. </p>,<p>I think that many employers would rather see some solid internships along with a solid set of references.</p>,<p>bootcamps generally cannot meaningfully provide all the necessary knowledge and skills through cramming.</p>,<p>Being on the other side of the table, I have interviewed one person who did a bootcamp, co the sample is pretty small, but she wasn't good and the project she mentioned she worked for the bootcamp seemed nonsensical as was the advice of a mentor she got.</p>"
