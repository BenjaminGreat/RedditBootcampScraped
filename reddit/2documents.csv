"I can say that the placement rate for General Assembly is pretty good (if you are agnostic on title, meaning analyst, scientist, engineer ect). It's somewhere around 75% at the 6 month mark. However, recently they have changed their teaching model, and I think its significantly worse, so I think their placement rate will suffer. ,Dont they take and recruit a lot from engineers which would make a title agnostic placement stats deceptive if including engineer?,I have not been impressed by their instructors as they grow.,I can't say much about the placement rate for bootcamps, but from the description of your experience, it sounds like you should be getting bites on your job applications, so I would investigate other reasons the job search is not going well (i.e. are your resume and cover letter good?).,Might want to give them a review, that's good feedback. My main limiting factor is the market. I'm in a small job market, not a lot of opportunity. Seeing lots of opportunities in California, Denver, and Seattle, only a few jobs a month where I'm at.,Do you mean do they have a lot of engineers in their class ? Some... but none of them are Data engineers "
"It's a lot of cash but it seems immersive. Where are you getting this consensus? ,That's just the impression I've developed mostly from articles and comments around reddit; I'm by no means an authority on the subject.,Maybe take a look at ,.,If it's a certificate you want, go for it. Though I don't know what the value is.,If you want to learn about Data Science and its content, look for (free) online courses and try out things with free software or trial versions.,I've basically gone through my whole career so far just teaching myself things, but a graduate degree proved that sometimes getting connected with a community is worth the money. Plus I suck at online classes. Will try to take this course and report back in May-ish. Thanks y'all"
